Test 1 is scheduled for next week first class and will cover content from or eBook Chapters 1, 2, and 3 or Blitzer Chapter 5 and 6.1 through 6.4. We will be covering section Blitzer 6.5 after Test 1. Test 1 is closed book, but you are permitted to bring in one half page of single sided handwritten notes that is 8.5 inches x 5.5 inches. I suggest you simply take a standard letter size paper and fold it in half. You can add to these notes in test 2 and 3.  You need to bring pencil, eraser, and calculator to Test 1. You may download and view [Sample Test 1](2012S1_test1.tst.pdf) available as a PDF file with answers attached.
  

<hr id="Week3">

## Week 3: Quadratic Equations, Graphing, and Functions

This week we will begin with Test 1, which will cover content from Chapters 1, 2, and 3 in the eBook or Sections 5.1 through 5.6 and 6.1 through 6.4 in the Blitzer textbook. Test 1 is closed book, but you are permitted to bring in one half page of handwritten notes on one side of an 8.5 inches x 5.5 inches area. I suggest you simply take a standard letter size paper and fold it in half. You can add to these notes for test 2 and 3.  Please bring pencil, eraser, and calculator to Test 1. You may download and view this Sample Test 1 which I used in class last year and is available as a PDF file for download.

After Test 1, we will continue with Blitzer Section 6.5 or eBook Chapter 4 covering the important topic of Quadratic equations to include polynomial operations, factoring, and the Quadratic Formula. A quadratic equation is a polynomial equation of the second degree, having the general form:

<figure><img alt="Quadratic Equation" src="QuadraticEqStd.gif"></figure>
The letters *a*, *b* and *c* are called coefficients: *a* is the coefficient of *x<sup>2</sup>*, *b* is the coefficient of *x*, and *c* is the constant coefficient. A quadratic equation has two solutions (i.e., solutions for the unknown term *x*). In some cases, these solutions can have the same value. The values of the solutions can be computed using the quadratic formula as shown below:
  
<figure><img alt="Quadratic Equation" src="QuadraticFormStd.gif"></figure>
For example, the solutions of the quadratic equation

<figure><img alt="Quadratic Equation" src="QuadraticEqNum.gif"></figure>  
can be determined by first substituting 2 for *a*, -14 for *b*, and 20 for *c* in the quadratic forumula 

<figure><img alt="Quadratic Equation" src="QuadraticFormNum.gif"></figure>  
and then solving the expression, which gives the solutions of the equation as *x* = 5 and *x* = 2.  

As the week progresses we will cover eBook Chapter 5.1 or Blitzer Chapter 7.1 covering mathematical functions and  Cartesian coordinate graphing. You will plot points, lines, and functions on graph paper.

 1. The ac-Method is a very systematic factoring method that allows you to factor trinomial mathematical expressions. Once you understand how to use the ac-method you can usually find the factors much quicker than FOIL. I found several videos on youtube.com covering the ac-Method. Try working out the exercises illustrated in these videos to understand the step-by-step factoring process. Then try it on homework exercises. If you find a different video that is helpful and easy to understand please email me and provide a hyperlink.

## Week 8: Final Exam Time

The Final Exam is the last class of the term. The Final Exam is comprehensive and any material covered in this eight week course may be on the Final Exam. The Final Exam is closed book, but you are permitted to bring in the [Formula Sheet](Math103FormulaSheet.pdf), pencil, eraser, and calculator. An example [Final Exam](Math%20103%20Practice%20Final%20Exam.pdf) and [Answers](Math 103 Practice Final Exam Solutions.pdf) can be downloaded and viewed here.  

I would like you to return your Tests 1, 2, and 3 to me during the final exam time. I re-examine these tests when determining final grades if you are within a few points of the next grade in the course.

I hope you feel are more comfortable with mathematics after taking this course and you will find it a useful skill when you apply it in life situations. It is your best critical thinking skill to help you make financial decisions. Mathematics is the basis of technology development and understanding physical sciences.
