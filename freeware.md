## Utilities
* [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) \[win, mac, linux, ios\]  = Screen dimmer helps you sleep better
    > Makes the color of your computer's display adapt to the time of day, warm at night and like sunlight during the day.
* [WinDirStat](http://windirstat.info/) \[win\]
> Search out big files wasting diskspace

* [Universal Media Server](http://www.universalmediaserver.com/) \[win, mac, linux\] = Universal Media Server is a DLNA-compliant UPnP Media Server

It's even possible that you're staying up too late because of your computer. You could use f.lux because it makes you sleep better, or you could just use it just because it makes your computer look better.
