        Week 8: GUI and Graphics Project completion
      </h3>
      <p>
        This week the focus will be on finishing and debugging Project 5. You will present
        your final project to the class in either class this week. Please verify
        your program does indeed work using test data before you present.
        There will be no new content for the course this week. If you would like
        me to review anything we can do it the first class this week.

  <h3>Week 7: Exception Handling and Graphics</h3>

  <p>This week we will cover the topics of Exception Handling and Graphics
  covered in Chapter 13 and Chapter 15. Of particular interest is exception
  handling of a GUI form covered in the slide set, but not in the book. We will
  also cover timer events covered in Section 16.12 which will enable you to do
  animation of a graphic. Project 4 is due class 1 this week and Project 5 will
  be assigned for completion the last class of Week 8.</p>

  <h3>Week 6: GUI Programming and Applets</h3>

  <p>This week we will continue with the topic of creating Graphical User
  Interfaces continuing with Chapter 17 and also Chapter 18. Project 4 is worth
  100 points and will be due Week 7 class 1.</p>

  <h3>Week 5: Event Driven Programming</h3>

  <p>This week we will be covering the topic of Event Driven Programming
  utilizing basic Swing components covered in part of Chapters 16 and 17.
  Chapter 16 content will be covered in the first class this week. You need to
  utilize content from only Chapter 16 to do Assignment 3 and you will have
  only until the second class this week to complete it.</p>

  <p>The hyperlinks to all required file downloads are shown and you should
  check and print these items before coming to class each week.<br>
  Please note that I have now uploaded all slide set PDFs as 2-slides per page
  for easier reading. Beginning with Chapter 11. The code is getting longer now
  that we have entered the world of OOP and GUI.</p>

  <h4>Assignment 3: Interactive GUI Assignment</h4>

  <p>Assignment 3 is worth 40 points and is due Thursday July 5. It is
  relatively short and can be done using content primarily from Chapter 14 and
  understanding of earlier chapters. You will make a GUI based program to
  convert between Fahrenheit and Celsius number systems. The program needs to
  utilize JFrame, JPanel, JLabel, JButton, JTextField Swing components. The
  program must be able to do both conversions F to C and C to F after the user
  clicks on their desired conversion.</p>

  <p>Now that we are firmly in the OOP GUI paradigm:<br>
  Step 1 is the creation of a suitable GUI.<br>
  Step 2 is the development of the ActionListener Inner Classes or
  AnonymoussListner methods to make the event model work with the GUI.</p>

  <p>You may want to review content from <a href=
  "http://polaris.umuc.edu/~rlaurie/cmis141/index.html#Week3">CMIS141</a> Slide
  Set 4 for Temperature Conversion Formula and known test data. Keep in mind we
  have left the procedural world behind and you now need to consider how to
  create Object Oriented Program applications with GUI's. Still the formula and
  test data are useful.</p>
  <hr id="Week4">

  <h3>Week 4: Abstract Classes and Interfaces</h3>

  <p>This week we will be covering partial content from Chapter 14 covering
  Abstract classes and Interfaces. The content is important because it provides
  the foundation to develop Graphical User Interfaces.</p>

  <p>This week you should try to convert your Assignment 2 code to be object
  oriented if you wrote it as procedural. It is time to think about objects and
  not procedures. You will have a difficult time with 80 point Project 4 if you
  are stuck in the procedural world.</p>

  <h3>Week 3: GUI Basics</h3>

  <p>This week we will be covering content from Chapter 12 - GUI Basics. The
  goal will be to make a simple window to display output.</p>

   <li>Assignment 2 is worth 40 points and will be due Thursday June 28. The
   goal of this assignment is to create a deck of cards, shuffle them, and then
   display a poker hand with the top 5 cards using actual images of cards. The
   cards should be shuffled randomly after each hand is dealt so you will
   unlikely see the same hand dealt twice. You may use the card images in the
   zip file or find another set of card images. <a href="classic-cards.zip"
   target="_blank">Card Images zip file</a></li>

   <li>The images should be unzipped and placed in an images folder within the
   Eclipse project folder. Right click on project folder and select Refresh to
   view image folder.</li>

   <li>You may utilize or modify my all-in-one <a href="Card1.java">Card1
   class</a> to assist you in developing this program.</li>

   <li>You can also use my modified dual <a href=
   "GroupOfCards.java">GroupOfCards class</a> composed from <a href=
   "Card.java">Card class</a></li>

   <li>In either case you will need to create a CardImage subclass of the Card
   class and also a GUI class with main</li>

   <li>You can view my <a href="docPoker12/index.html" target=
   "_blank">JavaDoc</a> for more information on these classes.</li>

   <li>Create a Word doc and describe the program summary and specifications.
   Create a UML image for your card class and also a flow chart for the main
   program sequencing. Paste the UML images into the word document.</li>

   <li>Upload your code to the Assignment 2 submit folder before the due
   date.</li>

  <h3>Week 2: Inheritance and Polymorphism</h3>

  <p>This week we will be covering content from Chapter 11 - Inheritance and
  Polymorphism. It is very abstract so please read before coming to the first
  class. Reading the material before it is covered in class will make the class
  seem a lot easier and you can ask better questions. If you have not received
  the book yet then please download the PDF file from the eChapters menu to the
  right or by clicking this link <a href=

  <h1>Welcome to CMIS242</h1>

  <h2>Intermediate Programming using Java</h2>

  <p><img id="myMug" alt="" src="MeSakuraSm.jpg" width="150" height="150" name=
  "myMug">This is a classic Face-to-Face class and we meet entirely in
  person.</p>

  <p>However, it is a web enhanced class, which means I will be posting course
  materials and grades online and you will upload your code for grading on the
  projects. So if you want to access course materials this is the place to go,
  but if you want to learn the material then come to class and read the book. I
  will post most course materials as PDF files here in the announcement
  section, so that you can print the materials in color prior to class.</p>

  <h4>So lets get started...</h4>

  <p><img src="Textbook8ed.jpg" alt="Textbook" height="154" width="120" border=
  "0"> The textbook for this course is very good so be sure to order it early
  so that you have it before the first week of class. We will be using the 8th
  edition which covers Java Standard Edition Version 6. Please download and
  install the Java Development Kit Version 6 on the computer that you intend to
  do your homework on. The book is concise, easy to read, and has lots of
  examples. Don't let the thickness scare you off, we will only be covering
  eleven chapters in this class Chapters 10 through 18 and Chapter 33 and
  34.</p>

  <p>Before the first class, I recommend that you download and print the latest
  updated version of the <a href="Cmis242Syllabus2012suIwakuni.pdf" target=
  "_blank">Syllabus</a> and other Week 1 materials described above which are
  posted as PDF files. I highly recommend using the freeware version of
  <a target="_blank" href=
  "http://www.docu-track.com/home/prod_user/PDF-XChange_Tools/pdfx_viewer">PDFXChangeViewer</a>,
  which allows you to make notes and save them to any PDF file.</p>

  <p>Please review my <a href="../cmis141/index.html" target="_blank">CMIS141
  course materials</a>, especially if I was not your instructor for CMIS141. I
  made many PowerPoint slides to support the course with excellent code
  examples and you can print these slide shows using the PDF files for the
  course. This CMIS141 material is presumed prerequisite knowledge for this
  class.</p>
