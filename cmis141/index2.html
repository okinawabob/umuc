        Week 8:
      </h3>
      <p>
        This week is the last week of classes and we begin the week with the
        final exam during the first class of the week. The final exam consists
        of 50 multiple choice questions and is closed book.
        However, you are permitted to bring in one 8.5 x 11 inches
        sheet of paper with handwritten notes on both sides. Again it is
        Tuesday this week and all time after will be devoted to finishing the
        final project. Don't forget that the Design phase is worth 50% of the
        grade and the final assignment must be turned in by Thursday
        before the end of class or you will receive a zero on it.
        No work will be accepted after the second class this week.
      </p>
      <p>
         There is no additional download this week, just complete the
         last assignment by this week.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has been a pleasure to teach you computer programming this session.
        JavaScript is the most important client side programming language that
        will become very important as all browsers move to HTML5. If you would
        like to continue learning the language I would recommend learning the
        JavaScript library called jQuery available at
        <a href="http://www.jquery.com"  target="_blank">www.jquery.com</a> which has some very
        cool affects for web pages and supports most browsers.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would like to encourage everyone to take CMIS141 next term, which
        covers application programming using the Java programming language.
        Java programs run as applications without the need of a web browser.
        They can also be designed to run on most operating systems.
        The syntax is very similar to JavaScript, but it is a pure object
        oriented language. The book is very good and is used for both classes
        CMIS141 and CMIS242.
       </p>
      <p>
        Programming and computer coding is a well paid and interesting career.
        Other computer classes that you may consider requesting as F2F
        classes that I am cleared to teach are:

      <h3>
        Week 7:
      </h3>
      <p>
        The seventh week we will focus on the topic of event driven programming
        using HTML forms to trigger events that call functions.
        We will discuss the document object model and Object based programming.
        The final program will require the design and implementation of a
        <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym>
        to solve a programming problem.
        Graphical User Interface program design is different then what you have
        encountered up to now in the course. You will design the GUI first using
        form elements. Then you will write the functions that will be triggered
        by form element events.
      </p>

        Week 6:
      </h3>
      <p>
        The sixth week we will focus on Chapter 6 content covering data
        Arrays. They allows you to have multiple variables with the same name
        and different index
        numbers. This is analogous to a post office with different box numbers.
        Arrays are a powerful method for storing
        data that enables the use of loops to process this data. Arrays are the
        way to implement mathematical matrix concepts.
        You will need to implement arrays in your Final Assignment 5.

      <h3>
        Week 5: Java Methods and Object Oriented Design
      </h3>
      <p>
        This week we will focus on Java Methods and their place in Object
        Oriented Design and Programming. Chapter 5 textbook content covers <i>Java
        Static Methods</i> and their use as programming functions. The Object
        Oriented Program concepts of classes and objects are covered in
        Chapter 8 of the textbook.
      </p>
      <p>
        Java Methods allow program processes to be encapsulated into functional
        modules. This is very similar and is an application of mathematical function concepts.
        Modularity enables the Top-Down design process, which is a
        "Divide and Conquer" approach to developing large programs by
        breaking it into smaller functional modules that can be designed, coded,
        and debugged separately. The Implementation Phase of program development
        usually utilizes a combination of Bottom-Up and Top-Down approaches for developing
        Java Methods and the calling of these methods from the <b>main</b> method.

        Week 4: Java Repetition Structures
      </h3>
      <p>
        The fourth week will focus on Repetition or Loop Programming Structure
        covered in Chapter 4 of the textbook. Repetition structures allow
        computer programs to process enormous amounts of structured data
        with relatively little program code. Homework 2 is due week 4 class 2
        and will require the implementation of a repetition structure with Java.
      </p>
      <p>
         This week we will also introduce the Eclipse IDE. I decided to go with
         eclipse because it seems the most stable and has the best tutorial documentation.
         If you prefer to use Netbeans that is fine too, but I will only be
         covering eclipse in class. Please watch  listed videos about installing
         eclipse and using the debugger.

        It maybe time for you to consider moving to an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for creating Java programs.
        IDEs can be complicated to learn, but they provide many features including debugging tools. 
        There are several free ones available for download, and Eclipse is the most common and has
        many plugins for developing code in many computer languages. Go to the Eclipse IDE link below
        and download the version of Eclipse for Java Developers. The other listed links provide videos
        demonstrating the use of Eclipse to do Java programming.

        Week 2: Developing a Java Program
      </h3>
      <p>
        This week we will explore the details of the Java language.
        You need to read Chapter 2 of the textbook before class this week.
        If you have not received your book yet then download the eChapter
        for <a href="CMIS%20141-242-440%20intro%20to%20java%20ch%202.pdf" target="_blank">Chapter 2 here</a>.
   </p>
      <p>
        We begin with Slide Set 2 which describes: operators, data types,
        and variables. Data types will be a new concept for some of you
        and they will allow better utilization of memory. Java has strict
        data typing and this week we will cover the primitive data types in detail.
      </p>
      <p>
         After the Java essentials will then progress to Java
         input and output using console I/O streams. Another alternative
         is to use use the Swing - Graphical User Interface components
         Swing JOptionPane. Both Input Output methods are described in Slide Set 3.

      <h3>Week 1: Programming Languages and Java Setup</h3>
      <p>
        This week we will be covering introductory content from Chapter
        1 about Programming Languages in general. We will learn
        how to install the Java language on a computer for development and how to
        compile and run Java language programs. Please read Chapter 1 as
        described on the syllabus before the first class. Reading the material
        before it is covered in  class will make the class seem a lot easier
        and you can ask better questions. If you have not received the book yet
        then please download the PDF file for
        <a href="CMIS%20141-242-440%20intro%20to%20java%20ch%201.pdf" target="_blank">

      </p>
      <p>You    need to bring a USB Drive to all classes to store computer
        files that you create in class and homework. If you have a notebook
        computer you should also bring that to class.
      </p>
      <p>
         I will utilize PowerPoint slides for lecture and discussion. They have
         the advantage that code can be tested and validated before class.
         Please print Slide Set 1 which is a PDF file with four slides per
         page in color. The hyperlinks to all  required file downloads for the course
         are on the first slide set. It is important to print the slides in color so you
         can view the syntax coloring of the code.  I have also posted the slide
         show online without narrations for your review. You need to come to
         class to hear the lectures.
