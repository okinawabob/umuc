      <h3> Week 8: Java Strings and File Read/Write </h3>
      <p> This week the focus will be on Java Strings considered as a class and
        reading, writing, and appending to text data files. Chapter 9 of the
        textbook is the primary content this week. Please read through this
        chapter and take the online quiz over the weekend. </p>
      <p> Please print Slide Set 9. The slide sets are posted as PDF documents
        with four slides per page in color. If you would like to view the slide
        show again then click the show item below. Project 3 the Final Project
        is worth 150 points and is due at the beginning of class 2. You will
        need to present your final project to the class describing both the
        design phase and display your Java source code. For this project your
        code should be commented in depth so that other people can understand
        your code. </p>

      <h3> Week 5: Java Methods and Object Oriented Design </h3>
      <p> This week we will focus on Java Methods and their place in Object
        Oriented Design and Programming. Chapter 5 textbook content covers <i>Java
          Static Methods</i> and their use as programming functions. The Object
        Oriented Program concepts of classes and objects are covered in Chapter
        8 of the textbook. </p>
      <p> Java Methods allow program processes to be encapsulated into
        functional modules. This is very similar and is an application of
        mathematical function concepts. Modularity enables the Top-Down design
        process, which is a "Divide and Conquer" approach to developing large
        programs by breaking it into smaller functional modules that can be
        designed, coded, and debugged separately. The Implementation Phase of
        program development usually utilizes a combination of Bottom-Up and
        Top-Down approaches for developing Java Methods and the calling of these
        methods from the <b>main</b> method. </p>

      <h3> Week 4: Java Repetition Structures </h3>
      <p> The fourth week will focus on Repetition or Loop Programming Structure
        covered in Chapter 4 of the textbook. Repetition structures allow
        computer programs to process enormous amounts of structured data with
        relatively little program code. Homework 2 is due week 4 class 2 and
        will require the implementation of a repetition structure with Java. </p>
      <p> This week we will also introduce the Eclipse IDE. I decided to go with
        eclipse because it seems the most stable and has the best tutorial
        documentation. If you prefer to use Netbeans that is fine too, but I
        will only be covering eclipse in class. Please watch listed videos about
        installing eclipse and using the debugger. </p>

      <p> It maybe time for you to consider moving to an Integrated Development
        Environment (IDE) for creating Java programs. IDEs can be complicated to
        learn, but they provide many features including debugging tools. There
        are several free ones available for download, and Eclipse is the most
        common and has many plugins for developing code in many computer
        languages. Go to the Eclipse IDE link below and download the version of
        Eclipse for Java Developers. The other listed links provide videos
        demonstrating the use of Eclipse to do Java programming. </p>

      <h3> Week 3: Java Selection Structures </h3>
      <p> This week we will finish Chapter 2 content and learn Chapter 3
        content. We will explore the Program Development Cycle, Program Flow of
        Control, Java Selection Structures, and operators typically utilized for
        selection structures to include relational and logical. </p>
      <p> You need to read Chapter 3 of the textbook before class this week. If
        you have not received your book yet then download the eChapter 3 from
        WebTycho.&nbsp; This is the lasteChapter. </p>

      <h3> Week 2: Developing a Java Program </h3>
      <p> This week we will explore the details of the Java language. You need
        to read Chapter 2 of the textbook before class this week. If you have
        not received your book yet then download&nbsp; eChapter 2 from WebTycho.
        There are eChapters for only the first three chapters of the textbook.
        Therefore, you must purchase a textbook very soon.&nbsp;</p>
      <p> We begin with Slide Set 2 which describes: operators, data types, and
        variables. Data types will be a new concept for some of you and they
        will allow better utilization of memory. Java has strict data typing and
        this week we will cover the primitive data types in detail. </p>
      <p> After the Java essentials we will then progress to Java input and
        output using console I/O streams. Another alternative is to use use the
        Swing - Graphical User Interface components Swing JOptionPane. Both
        Input Output methods are described in Slide Set 3. </p>
      <p> Please print Slide Sets 2 and 3, before coming to class this week. The
        slide sets are posted as PDF documents with four slides per page in
        color. Also posted is an explaination of number systems and codes for
        those that did not take CMIS102 with me. If you would like to view the

      <h3>Week 1: Programming Languages and Java Setup</h3>
      <p> This week we will be covering introductory content from Chapter 1
        about Programming Languages in general. We will learn how to install the
        Java language on a computer for development and how to compile and run
        Java language programs. Please read Chapter 1 as described on the
        syllabus before the first class. Reading the material before it is
        covered in class will make the class seem a lot easier and you can ask
        better questions. If you have not received the book yet then please
        download the eChapter 1 as a PDF file from WebTycho. </p>
      <p>You need to bring a USB Drive to all classes to store computer files
        that you create in class and homework. If you have a notebook computer
        you should also bring that to class. </p>
      <p> I will utilize PowerPoint slides for lecture and discussion. They have
        the advantage that code can be tested and validated before class. Please
        print Slide Set 1 which is a PDF file with four slides per page in
        color. The hyperlinks to all required file downloads for the course are
        on the first slide set. It is important to print the slides in color so
        you can view the syntax coloring of the code. I have also posted the
        slide show online without narrations for your review. You need to come
        to class to hear the lectures. </p>

      <p> However, it is a web enhanced class, which means I will be posting
        course materials and grades online but little else. So if you want to
        access course materials this is the place to go, but if you want to
        learn the material then come to class. I will post most course materials
        as PDF files here in the announcement section, so that you can print the

        The textbook for this course is very good so be sure to order it early
        so that you have it before the first week of class. We will be using the
        8th edition which covers Java Standard Edition Version 6. Please
        download and install the Java Development Kit Version 6 on the computer
        that you intend to do your homework on. The book is concise, easy to
        read, and has lots of examples. Don't let the thickness scare you off,
        we will only be covering the first nine chapters in this class and will
        also use the book in CMIS242 for those that would like to continue. </p>
      <p> Before the first class, I recommend that you download and print the
        latest updated version of the <a href="Cmis141Syllabus2012S2Iwakuni.pdf"
          target="_blank">Syllabus</a> and other Week 1 materials described

          PDFXChangeViewer</a>, which allows you to make notes and save them to
