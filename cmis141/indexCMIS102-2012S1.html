        Week 8:
      </h3>
      <p>
        This week is the last week of classes and we begin the week with the
        final exam during the first class of the week. The final exam consists
        of 50 multiple choice questions and is closed book.
        However, you are permitted to bring in one 8.5 x 11 inches
        sheet of paper with handwritten notes on both sides. Again it is
        Tuesday this week and all time after will be devoted to finishing the
        final project. Don't forget that the Design phase is worth 50% of the
        grade and the final assignment must be turned in by Thursday
        before the end of class or you will receive a zero on it.
        No work will be accepted after the second class this week.
      </p>
      <p>
         There is no additional download this week, just complete the
         last assignment by this week.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has been a pleasure to teach you computer programming this session.
        JavaScript is the most important client side programming language that
        will become very important as all browsers move to HTML5. If you would
        like to continue learning the language I would recommend learning the
        JavaScript library called jQuery available at
        <a href="http://www.jquery.com"  target="_blank">www.jquery.com</a> which has some very
        cool affects for web pages and supports most browsers.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would like to encourage everyone to take CMIS141 next term, which
        covers application programming using the Java programming language.
        Java programs run as applications without the need of a web browser.
        They can also be designed to run on most operating systems.
        The syntax is very similar to JavaScript, but it is a pure object
        oriented language. The book is very good and is used for both classes
        CMIS141 and CMIS242.
       </p>
      <p>
        Programming and computer coding is a well paid and interesting career.
        Other computer classes that you may consider requesting as F2F
        classes that I am cleared to teach are:
      </p>
      <ul>
      	<li>CMIS141: Introduction to Programming (Java)</li>
      	<li>CMIS242: Intermediate programming (Java)</li>

      <h3>
        Week 7:
      </h3>
      <p>
        The seventh week we will focus on the topic of event driven programming
        using HTML forms to trigger events that call functions.
        We will discuss the document object model and Object based programming.
        The final program will require the design and implementation of a
        <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym>
        to solve a programming problem.
        Graphical User Interface program design is different then what you have
        encountered up to now in the course. You will design the GUI first using
        form elements. Then you will write the functions that will be triggered
        by form element events.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please print the final Slide Set 7, before coming to class.
        The slide sets are posted as PDF documents with four slides per

      <h3>
        Week 6:
      </h3>
      <p>
        The sixth week we will focus on Chapter 6 content covering data
        Arrays. They allows you to have multiple variables with the same name
        and different index
        numbers. This is analogous to a post office with different box numbers.
        Arrays are a powerful method for storing
        data that enables the use of loops to process this data. Arrays are the
        way to implement mathematical matrix concepts.
        You will need to implement arrays in your Final Assignment 5.
      </p>
      <p>Assignment 4 is due this week at the beginning of class 2</p>
      <p>
        Please print Assignment 5 and Slide Set 7, before coming to

      <h3>
        Week 5: Program Functions
      </h3>
      <p>
        The fifth week second class begins with the Midterm-Exam covering content from the
        first half of the course. You are permitted to bring in one 8.5 x 11
        inches sheet of paper with handwritten notes on one side for this Exam.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the exam we will focus on Chapter 7 content covering Program
        Functions which allows you to break up your code into modules. Functions
        are defined with a function definition, which specifies what code will
        be executed when the function is called. A function can be called from
        your main program, other functions, or
        <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym> events.
        This will be a difficult concept for some especially if you have not
        learned algebraic functions in the past. Assignment 4 will be assigned
        this week covering function programming.

        The fourth week will focus on Chapter 4 and 5 content covering Repetition
        Structures which allows your programs to loop. The is often used to
        process enormous amounts of structured data with relatively little
        program code. Assignment 3 will be assigned this week covering
        repetition structure programming.

        This will be a web enhanced class, which means I will be
        posting course materials and grades online but little else. So
        if you want to access course materials this is the place to go,
        but if you want to communicate with me then come to class.
        I am going to make it easy for all of us so everything will be
        posted in the Class Announcements section alone with links to
        PDF files. No need to do a lot of searching around WebTycho.

      </h4>
      <p>
        Before the first class, I recommend that you download and print
        the latest updated version of the
        <a href="CMIS102Syllabus2012S1_Iwakuni.pdf" target="_blank">Syllabus</a>
        and other Week 1 materials described above which are posted as
        PDF files. I highly recommend using the freeware version of
        <a target="_blank" href=
        "http://www.docu-track.com/home/prod_user/PDF-XChange_Tools/pdfx_viewer">
        PDFXChangeViewer</a>, which allows you to make notes and save them to
        any PDF file.
