<p><img src="../MyMug150_2014.gif" alt="My Face">This is a classic Face-to-Face class and we meet entirely in person. There will be no online discussions and if you have a question you can ask in class or email me at</p>
<p style='margin-top: 0;'><script>AntiSpam('moc', 'tsmc+82.1lmr', 'liamg', 'CMST386 Question?', '')</script></p>
<p>I will post handouts and hyperlinks to videos for the class on this web page which is accessible through the URL <a href="https://okinawabob.github.io/umuc/cmst386/" target="_blank">https://okinawabob.github.io/umuc/cmst386/</a></p>
<p>Please bookmark (favorites) this URL in your browser so that you can easily return to it as the course progresses.</p>
<h2>So lets get started…</h2>
<p>The course has as a prerequisite CMST385 to insure students come into the class with intermediate computer skills and a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and web images.</p>
<p>The primary references for the class will be the following web sites:</p>
<ul class="link">
<li><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/" target="_blank">www.w3schools.com/html/</a> a great reference for both HTML and CSS</li>
<li><a href="http://learn.shayhowe.com/" target="_blank">learn.shayhowe.com/</a> created by a professional web developer.</li>
</ul>
<p>UMUC no longer utilizes books for their courses, because free online resources have been setup for the course as can be viewed at <a href="http://campus.umuc.edu/" target="_blank">LEO</a>.</p>
<p>Print all Week 1 materials described below that are posted as PDF files. I recommend using the freeware version of <a href="http://www.docu-track.com/home/prod_user/PDF-XChange_Tools/pdfx_viewer" target="_blank">PDFXChangeViewer</a>, which allows you to make notes and save them to any PDF file or you can use Adobe Acrobat Reader.</p>
<p>All software used in this class is freeware and I strive to find software that can be run on all common operating systems (Windows, MacOSX, Linux).</p>
<p>I recommend that you get started with Week 1 content today, by clicking Week 1 in the navigation bar above or scrolling down.</p>

<h2 id="Week1" class="week">Week 1: HTML5, GitHub Pages Setup, and <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr></h2>

    <div class="imgPopup">
      <a target="_blank" href="1-web-designer-vs-web-developer.jpg">
        <img src="1s-web-designer-vs-web-developer.jpg" alt="Designer vs Developer">
      </a>
    </div>
    <p>
      The first week we will be getting familiar with a new web server to host pages, consider a new code editor called Atom, review HTML5 elements, and examine Search Engine Optimization. UMUC no longer has a <abbr title="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_burning">textbook</abbr> for the course and seems to be relying on videos for learning the material in this course, so we will be viewing these in class. The LEO video links are described in the <strong>Read &amp; Watch from LEO</strong> section below and many are hosted by Microsoft as part of their various certification programs.
    </p>
    <p>
     I have also created links to interesting videos that I have found about various web topics. One series I like is by the web developer <a href="http://travisneilson.com/" target="_blank">Travis Neilson</a> who currently works at Google and I will be linking to many of his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DevTipsForDesigners"  target="_blank">YouTube Channel Videos</a>. Start with his two videos linked below:
    </p>
    <ul class="vid">
      <li><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/OFDAGiPJHL8">Advice and Crap for Young Creators</a>9m</li>
      <li><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/QLbUzwxkwHA">My First Websites Were Horrible!</a>19m</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Reading assignment to do prior to class this week: </h4>
    <p>I have provided links to ebooks for those that still <abbr title="are not illiterate">like to read</abbr>. This weeks reading assignment will be to read all material listed in <strong>Read &amp; Watch from LEO</strong> section below and read <strong>Lesson 12 - Writing Your Best Code</strong> from Shay Howe's book <br>
    <em>Learn to Code by  book HTML &amp; CSS</em> or his web site <a href="http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/">learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/</a></p>
    <ul class="read">

      <li><strong>Read &amp; Watch from LEO</strong> below</li>
    </ul>

<h3>GitHub and GitPages Web Hosting</h3>
<p>The first week we need to get familiar with our new web hosting, which will utilize GitHub Pages. Pancake.io has become unreliable so time for a change. This requires you to create a GitHub account, install a desktop application, and utilize GitHub Pages.</p>
<p> I have including links to videos that describe GitHub below and an ebook for those that like to read. Please view and read so you have a better understanding of GitHub and the Git <abbr title="Version Control System">VCS</abbr>.
<ul class="vid">

<ul class="read">
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.syncfusion.com/resources/techportal/details/ebooks/GitHub_Succinctly">GitHub Succinctly ebook</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Sign up for a GitHub account at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/">github.com/</a>.</p>
<p>After you have complete this process then download and install the GitHub desktop application for your operating system at <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">desktop.github.com/</a>.
</p>
<p>After you have completed this install process then setup GitHub Pages on your account by following the process described on the videos below.

</ul>
<h3>Code Editors</h3>
<p>We will need a text editor to edit our code HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. In the previous class I recommended <a href="http://komodoide.com/komodo-edit/" target="_blank">Komodo Edit</a> and if you are happy with it please continue to use it. You can utilize any text editor with GitHub in the class. If you are looking for something new and trendy, that is also GitHub aware try using <a target="_blank" href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>, the newly developed <q>hackable</q> editor.</p>
<p>If you would like to try Atom download and install it at <a target="_blank" href="https://atom.io/">https://atom.io/</a> and read the <a target="_blank" href="http://flight-manual.atom.io/">Atom Flight Manual</a>. Watch the videos below and also print my Atom Code Editor Notes and Emmet Quick Reference.</p>

<h2>Best Practices with Images, Privacy and Legal Rights</h2>
<p>There
       are privacy and legal concerns when taking photos and posting them on a
       website.</p>
   <p><br>
       You took some pictures of the Little League baseball team practicing.
       You want to use them on your website about the team. Can you? Do you
       need parental permission? Here's some useful advice:<br>

<h2>How To Create A Privacy Policy</h2>
A
      privacy policy tells visitors to your site what information you’ll collect
      and what you’ll do with it. This is important for eCommerce sites or for
      sites where you setup user accounts and logins. It’s also important for
      sites that collect information via web forms. What if you don’t do any of
      those things? It’s still recommended to have a privacy statement to cover
      things like cookies and information gained from site analytics.<strong><br>
      </strong><br>
    This
      article tells you how to write a privacy policy for your website. It also
      offers a number of free templates so you don’t have to reinvent the wheel:<br

      the website you're creating need a "Terms of Service" agreement?<br

     Before
       adding a copyright statement to your website, make sure that all of the
       content (text, images, scripts, etc) on your site that is not original has
       been properly cited. Not
       sure how to do that? Visit:<br>

     <br>
     Simply
       adding a copyright to your web pages doesn't automatically protect you.
       But telling people that you own the content is a good first step.<br

     This
       is a service intended as a way to keep up on news. If you really liked<span

         class="Apple-converted-space">opihi picking,
       you could have google email you whenever that term came up somewhere new
       on the web (or at least in the Google index). Emails are sent at intervals
       – you don't get spammed.<br>
     <br>
     So
       who cares about that? You can do a couple of things.. setup an alert on
       your main page URL. This'll<span

         class="Apple-converted-space">tell you when people are
       linking to you (a good thing). Also setup alerts on a combination of
       keywords you think will be somewhat specific to your site – preferably in
       your meta tags. Or setup an alert on a key phrase that appears in your
       main page. Many people who rip off content will be too stupid to change
       these things. If they weren't lazy, they wouldn't be ripping you off in
       the first place.<span

<h2>E-commerce &amp; Shopping Cart Software, Payments, Newsletters</h2>
<p><strong>Shopping
     Cart Software via your Web Host</strong></p>
<p>If
   you're selling something on the web, you need some sort of Shopping Cart
   software. You can write your own or you can tap into something that
   already exists. When considering web hosting for your business, see what
   Shopping Cart software your host provides. In many cases, you'll get
   free access. If that doesn't pan out, then you may decide to move on to
   either free or paid shopping cart software.</p>
<p><strong>Shopping
     Cart Software</strong></p>
<p>Here's
   a handy comparison of Shopping cart software. Make a note of the cost
   and the language it's written in. You'll need to make sure the shopping
   cart you select is in a language that your web host supports (PHP, ASP,
   etc.)<br>

<h2>Writing For The Web</h2>
<p>Well
        written content can make your website more successful. If people can't
        figure out what your site is about and what you have to offer, they'll
        leave. If your site is comprised mainly of links to other sites with
        nothing original, visitors will recognize this and then leave.</p>

          <h2>Personal Web Site Security - Keeping Your Data Safe</h2>

           <p>There are many facets of Internet Security. One major focus is
               keeping the information stored on your computer private. These days we
               face a number of threats. We could lose data due to a virus, a hacker,
               hardware failure or user error. We could be using software that secretly
               sends information on us to others. We could be using a broadband
               connection to the internet that allows hackers to take over the
               connection and appear as us.<br>
             </p>
           <p><strong>Viruses</strong></p>
           <p>Back in the 'good old days' you could only get a virus if you ran
               an infected program or shared data on floppy disks. Now viruses come in
               all shapes and sizes. You may find a virus embedded in a Word document.
               You may find a virus embedded in a web page or attached to email. Of
               these, the most prevalent these days seems to be the virus attached to
               email. Simply opening a message (or displaying it in the preview pane of
               Outlook or Outlook Express) is enough to infect your system. Most email
               viruses turn around and mail themselves to everyone in your address
               book. For this reason, saying that you "only click on email attachments
               from people you know" is a poor defense. It's the people you know who
               are most likely to accidentallly send you a virus.<br>
             <br>
             What can be done about this? Install and use a good virus protection
               program such as Norton Antivirus or McAfee's Virus Scan. A final key
               step is updating your virus program regularly. These programs can only
               scan for viruses they know exist. Unfortunately, new viruses are
               invented almost daily. When a new virus pops up, the antivirus software
               company adds that virus definition to the database or "signature file"
               for it's virus detection product. The only way to protect yourself
               against new viri is to regularly check for and download the new
               signature files.<br>
             <br>
             Some virus information resources:<br>
             F-Secure Virus InfoCenter -<a href="http://www.f-secure.com/virus-info/">http://www.f-secure.com/virus-info/</a><br>
             McAfee Advert: Virus Information Center -<a href="http://vil.nai.com/vil/default.asp">http://vil.nai.com/vil/default.asp</a><br>
             Symantec (Norton) Virus Information Center: -<a href="http://securityresponse.symantec.com/">http://securityresponse.symantec.com/</a></p>
           <p><br>
             <strong>Firewalls</strong></p>
           <p>A firewall is designed to prevent unauthorized access to your
               computer. Firewalls can be either hardware or software or both.
               Firewalls are most common in the workplace. With the advent of home
               networks and broadband (cable or DSL) connections, firewalls have found
               their way into the home as well.<br>
             <br>
             Those using cable or DSL internet connections are more likely to
               experience outside attacks. Hackers look for high speed connections.
               When they find one, they send a 'denial of service' to the browser. If
               your browser requests information that you aren't authorized to see, the
               requestee can send a message telling the browser to get lost. Certain
               types of these messages can confuse the browser into dropping the
               internet connection. With this done, the hacker can take over your
               connection and can appear as you online.<br>
             <br>
             If you'd like to try a firewall but don't want to fork over any
               money, you can use a free version of ZoneAlarm available at:<a href="http://www.zonelabs.com/store/content/home.jsp">http://www.zonelabs.com/store/content/home.jsp</a><br>
             You'll see a "Pro" version available for sale and a free version
               available for download.</p>
           <p><strong>Encryption</strong></p>
           <p>During the second week of this class, we did an assignment that
               involved using a Traceroute utility. That showed that information goes
               through a series of several "hops" on it's way from one place to
               another. To secure information, encryption is used. Encryption is the
               process of translating your data into a type of "secret code." There are
               two types of encryption:<br>
             <br>
             Asymmetric encryption (also called public key) is most often used to
               preclude the exchange of keys among many users, particularly in
               situations where the users are not known to each other.<br>
             <br>
             Symmetric encryption is most often used where key distribution is
               limited to an exchange among a few users (e.g., in banks).<br>
             <br>
             Your browser already has encryption built into it. In order to get
               the best encryption, stay as current as you possibly can with your
               browser. Staying current means using the latest version that will run on
               your system. It also means downloading all of the security patches and
               upgrades for that version. If you use MSIE, you can find updates
               at<a href="http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/">WindowsUpdate.Microsoft.com</a>.</p>
           <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
           <p>A cookie is a small file that resides on your hard drive. Cookies
               can store passwords or name/address/billing info so that you don't have
               to reenter it each time you make an order at your favorite shopping
               site. In order for these to work, the information must be written to a
               file on your hard drive. Later, the info has to be accessed (loaded) by
               a web page such as your favorite shopping site. This all sounds very
               convenient. The problem is that we can't always control who is accessing
               our cookies or what is being done with the information. Some companies
               have used cookies to gather information about our browsing practices in
               the hope of sending targeted ads. It is possible to turn off cookies but
               doing so will cause some features on web pages to stop working. Many
               find that the constant nagging to turn cookies back on is too annoying.
               If you'd like more information on Cookies, check out the<a href="http://www.cookiecentral.com/faq/">Unofficial
                 Cookie FAQ</a>.</p>
           <p><strong>Browser Cache and History</strong></p>
           <p>If you share your computer with other users, your browser cache and
               history files are potential security risks. A later user can use these
               features to find out where you've been on the Internet and possibly even
               view private information.<br>
             <br>
             Regularly cleaning your browser's cache can also speed up browsing.
               When you visit web pages, these pages are saved in your cache. When you
               revisit the same page, instead of downloading it from the internet, it
               can be called up from the cache file on your hard drive. That's much
               faster at first. But after time, you end up with hundreds, even
               thousands of pages in your cache. Each time you enter a URL, your
               browser first checks to see if that page is in the cache. You have to
               sit while it scans through all of those pages. Cleaning the cache file
               gives you a fresh start.</p>
           <h3>What are adware or spyware?</h3>
           <p>Adware and Spyware are loosely used terms that describe programs
               that are generally undesirable, doing things that you don't want done.
               This short tutorial looks as the types of Adware and Spyware out there
               then it offers ways to protect yourself from them.<br>
             </p>
           <h3>Ad Supported Software or services</h3>
           <p>A program or service gives you something for free in exchange for
               showing you ads. The terms of the advertising are clearly stated in the
               end user license agreement (EULA). An example of this may be Yahoo
               Geocities giving you free space to host your website in exchange for
               displaying ads on your pages.</p>
           <h3>Adware</h3>
           <p>Adware seeks to sell products or services by any means possible.
               These may include:<br>
             <strong>Displaying General Ads</strong>- Displaying pop-up,
               pop-under or banner ads without your permission.<br>
             <strong>Displaying targeted ads</strong>- This involves tracking the
               URLs you visit and displaying ads based upon that information. This
               tracking is often done using tracking cookies or data miners.<br>
             <strong>Home Page Hijacking</strong>- An adware installer changes
               your browser homepage to its homepage without your knowledge or
               permission.<br>
             <strong>Search Settings Hijacking</strong>- Your default search
               engine is changed to use the adware installer's page.<br>
             <strong>Search Results Hijacking</strong>- You think you're using
               your favorite search engine but the results you see are really coming
               from the Adware installer.<br>
             <strong>Dialers</strong>use your existing modem and phone line
               to place calls to pay-per-minute services so that you can be billed for
               usage. (If you have a Cable or DSL Internet connection and don't need
               your modem for faxing, disconnecting the phone line will offer complete
               protection from dialers.)</p>
           <h3>Spyware</h3>
           <p>Spyware invades your privacy and collects personal information such
               as UserIDs, Passwords, Credit Card Numbers or other banking information,
               or CD Keys to game programs.<br>
             <strong>URL Logging</strong>- Your browser history or the websites
               you visit is logged and sent by some means to a remote user. This
               tracking is often done using tracking cookies, data miners or Web bugs
               (ActiveX Controls).<br>
             <strong>Keylogging</strong>- Every key you type at your keyboard is
               recorded and shared with a remote user. Often keyloggers also take
               screen shots and record mouse clicks. There are legitimate uses for
               keyloggers. They can be used by parents who want to know what their kids
               are doing online or by employers who want to track employees computer
               usage. But when they're installed without your knowledge, they're
               classified as spyware.<br>
             <strong>Phishing</strong>- You receive a genuine looking email
               asking for personal information. You think this email comes from a
               legitimate company you do business with so you send the requested
               information. Phishing can also be done via web pages. Example: You get
               an email saying your PayPal account has expired. You click a link in the
               email to go to what looks exactly like PayPal's website. The URL looks
               correct. You enter your ID, Password and Credit Card # to "reactivate"
               your account. When you hit the [Submit] button, your information is sent
               to a remote user.<br>
             Sometimes you'll initiate a process that results in adware
               installation (signing up for an auto-update site, filling out an online
               registration form, etc.) But it's possible to simply visit a web page
               without initiating a download yourself and end up with programs or
               processes running on your system without your knowledge or consent.</p>
           <h3>Fakeware - Rogue Security Programs</h3>
           <p>Fakeware is a term used to refer to Rogue Security programs. These
               programs generate popups telling you that your system is infected or
               there there are system problems. It offers you a free scan. False
               positives (viruses, registry errors, etc) are generated to get you to
               buy the full program. If you decline, you're nagged about fixing those
               problems you don't really have. Many are so bad that they're classified
               by antivirus programs as Trojans (generally Trojan.FakeAlert(. These
               programs can appear quite real and legitimate. You'll find listings of
               the programs to avoid at<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_security_software"

                 target="_new">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_security_software</a>.

             While some of these articles mention good utilities that can be used
               to remove spyware from your system and your Windows Registry, the most

               should also be aware of "fakeware". These are programs that say they
               remove adware/spyware but actually install it. You can check to see if
               the program you use is good, bad, or ugly at:<br>

<h2>Cross-Promoting Your Website and Business</h2>
<p>The idea of Cross promotion is to build bridges between your online
    business resources and your real world business.<br>
    <br>
    Here are some examples:<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Put your URL on your business cards.</strong><br>
    <br>
    <strong>Create a YouTube channel.</strong><br>
    Publish informational videos related to your business. Embed your URL in
    the videos and then embed your videos in your website.<br>
    Create a presence on social media sites such as FaceBook, Twitter, and
    LinkedIn. If you don’t have time to tweet about your business, there’s
    software that can help automate the process: <a href="http://hootsuite.com/">http://hootsuite.com/</a>.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Add the popular social media “like” Icons to your website.</strong><br>
    <br>
    At the very least you want Facebook “Like” and Google “+1” buttons.<br>
    Facebook Like button: <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like/">http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like/</a><br>
    Google +1 button: <a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/+1/button/">http://www.google.com/webmasters/+1/button/</a><br>
    Or you can use a tool like AddThis that gives you everything in one
    widget: <a href="http://www.addthis.com/">http://www.addthis.com/</a>.
    Be careful. If you put Addthis in the wrong location, it could break
    your page validation.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Market via Text Message.</strong><br>
    This article from eCommerceTimes offers methods of promoting your
    website via text message: <a href="http://www.ecommercetimes.com/story/Short-and-Sweet-Text-Marketing-75106.html">http://www.ecommercetimes.com/story/Short-and-Sweet-Text-Marketing-75106.html</a>.
    Obviously there are good and bad ways to do this. Downloading a free Web
    to SMS program and spamming the known world is an example of one of the
    bad ways. Creating a web form that lets visitors 'opt in' to text
    message alerts, tweets, RSS, pod-or-vodcasts, or an email newsletter
    would be a better idea.</p>

    Are there ideas you'd like to add to the list?</p>

<h2>How To Create A Sitemap</h2>
<p><strong>SiteMaps</strong><br>
  <br>
  As part of your web project proposal you created a site map diagram
    to show how your site would be organized. Now you'll create an xml
    sitemap to improve your chances of being indexed into search engines
    like Google, Bing and Yahoo. Google recommends creating a sitemap if
    your site:</p>
<ul>
  <li>has dynamic content.</li>
  <li>has pages that aren't easily discovered by Googlebot during the
      crawl process—for example, pages featuring rich AJAX or images.</li>
  <li>is new and has few links to it. (Googlebot crawls the web by
      following links from one page to another, so if your site isn't well
      linked, it may be hard for us to discover it.)</li>
  <li>has a large archive of content pages that are not well linked to
      each other, or are not linked at all.</li>
</ul>

<h2>/Web Site Security - Keeping Others Data Safe</h2>
<p>As web designers, we owe it to our customers or visitors to keep

<h1>Going Mobile, Anyone</h1>
<p><strong>In the 90s we were talking about the web "going global".
      Now we're talking about it "going mobile".</strong><br>
  <br>
  Please take a few minutes to read the following article and consider
    what you'll do to make your website work for mobile devices.<br>
  Will you create a complete version of your website just for mobile
    devices? Which devices? What about screen sizes?<br>
  Will you wait a bit and use the CSS3 Media option?<br>
  At the bottom of this post you'll find some tools to "Mobilize" your
    site. Are they worthwhile?<br>
  <br>
  Guidelines For Mobile Web Development<br>
  Full Article Link:<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/guidelines-for-mobile-web-development/">http://www.smashingmagazine.com/guidelines-for-mobile-web-development/</a></p>
<p>This overview features a hand-picked and organized selection of the
    most useful and popular Smashing Magazine’s articles related to design
    and development for mobile devices and published here over all the
    years.</p>
<div>
  <h2><a title="Permanent Link to Making It a Mobile Web App" href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/01/26/making-it-a-mobile-web-app/"

        rel="bookmark"><strong>Making It A Mobile Web App</strong></a></h2>
  <p>Ask any interactive agency nowadays what their clients are asking
      for when they need a mobile experience — the answer will inevitably be
      “an iPhone and/or an iPad app.” Native Apple apps are a hot commodity,
      and in today’s mobile application ecosystem, mobile web apps are not
      sexy. In fact, many people don’t even realize they are even an option.
      In certain cases, an iPhone/iPad app will be the right solution for
      their needs.</p>
  <p>However, there are some situations where it may become a
      short-term win, but eventually a long-term loss. Mobile web apps offer
      a good number of advantages over native apps; and though they face
      some design, development and deployment challenges, they are a
      powerful cross platform, scalable and affordable solution.</p>
  <h2><a title="Permanent Link to How To Build A Mobile Website" href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/11/03/how-to-build-a-mobile-website/"

        rel="bookmark">How To Build A Mobile Website</a></h2>
  <p><strong>Over the past few years, mobile web usage has
        considerably increased</strong>to the point that web
      developers and designers can no longer afford to ignore it. In wealthy
      countries, the shift is being fueled by faster mobile broadband
      connections and cheaper data service. However, a large increase has
      also been seen in developing nations where people have skipped over
      buying PCs and gone straight to mobile.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, the mobile arena introduces a layer of complexity
      that can be difficult for developers to accommodate. Mobile
      development is more than cross-browser, it should be<strong>cross-platform</strong>.
      The vast number of mobile devices makes thorough testing a practical
      impossibility, leaving developers nostalgic for the days when they
      only had to support legacy browsers.</p>
  <h2><a title="Permanent Link to How To Use CSS3 Media Queries To Create a Mobile Version of Your Website"

        href="http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2010/07/19/how-to-use-css3-media-queries-to-create-a-mobile-version-of-your-website/"

        rel="bookmark">How To Use CSS3 Media Queries To Create A Mobile
        Version Of Your Website</a></h2>
  <p>CSS3 continues to both excite and frustrate web designers and
      developers. We are excited about the possibilities that CSS3 brings,
      and the problems it will solve, but also frustrated by the lack of
      support in Internet Explorer 8. This article will demonstrate a
      technique that uses part of CSS3 that is also unsupported by Internet
      Explorer 8. However,<strong>it doesn’t matter</strong>as
      one of the most useful places for this module is somewhere that does
      have a lot of support – small devices such as the iPhone, and Android
      devices.</p>
  <p>In this article I’ll explain how, with a few CSS rules, you can
      create an iPhone version of your site using CSS3, that will work now.
      We’ll have a look at a very simple example and I’ll also discuss the
      process of adding a small screen device stylesheet to my own site to
      show how easily we can add stylesheets for mobile devices to existing
      websites.</p>

  <p>The world of mobile app development is quickly becoming a crowded
      and complicated space, especially for those outside of the development
      niche. “Which development platform should I use?” “Do I go native or
      Web-based?” “Which devices should I plan for?” “Can I build my mobile
      website by hand or should I use a pre-built package?” The questions
      are endless.</p>
  <p>As a designer, my job is to help my clients answer these
      questions. I try to stay in the category of “knowing enough to be
      dangerous,” and I keep tabs on the latest mobile development trends,
      one being the growing popularity of mobile Web apps.</p>

        rel="bookmark">Picking A Mobile Support Strategy For Your Website</a></h2>
  <p>The number of people browsing the Web from a mobile device has
      more than tripled since 2009, and it is sure to continue growing, with
      browser platforms such as iOS and Android offering mobile browser
      support that is almost identical to what we have come to expect from a
      desktop experience. As the mobile consumer market continues to grow,
      so will the aspirations of individuals and companies who look to
      embrace what the mobile Web has to offer.</p>
  <p>With this in mind, many website owners have begun to develop a
      strategy for providing information and services to their mobile
      visitors. However, mobile strategies can vary massively from website
      to website, depending on what the company wants to offer visitors. For
      example, eBay’s strategy will be very different from an individual’s
      strategy for a portfolio website, which might simply be to improve
      readability for those viewing on a mobile device.</p>

        rel="bookmark">A User-Centered Approach To Web Design For Mobile
        Devices</a></h2>
  <p>For the past few years, we’ve heard pundits declaring each year
      as “year of the mobile Web”; each year trying to sound more convincing
      than the previous. Whether 2011 will be the real “year of the mobile”
      remains to be seen, but what is indisputable is the fact that the
      mobile usage of the Web is growing and evolving. As it evolves, so
      does the<strong>mobile user experience</strong>, driven by advances in
      mobile device technology — from better browsers on basic mobile phones
      (or feature phones — remember the Motorola RAZR?) to the increased
      adoption of smartphones and tablets.</p>
  <p>The term “Mobile Web” (although often<a href="http://www.the-haystack.com/2011/01/07/there-is-no-mobile-web/">criticized</a><sup

        class="print_only">13</sup>) is commonly used to describe
      accessing the internet using a mobile device. This definition is broad
      enough to cover everything from using a browser on a feature phone, to
      using highly customized apps on smartphones or tablets.</p>
  <h2><a title="Permanent Link to Forms On Mobile Devices: Modern Solutions"

        rel="bookmark">Forms On Mobile Devices: Modern Solutions</a></h2>
  <p>Mobile forms tend to have significantly more constraints than
      their desktop cousins: screens are smaller; connections are slower;
      text entry is trickier; the list goes on. So, limiting the number of
      forms in your mobile applications and websites is generally a good
      idea. When you do want input from users on mobile devices, radio
      buttons, checkboxes, select menus and lists tend to work much better
      than open text fields.</p>
  <p>But<strong>constraints breed innovation</strong>, and
      mobile forms are no different. The limitations of mobile devices have
      forced developers and designers to find new ways to allow users to
      input data faster and more easily. Thanks to the modern solutions
      covered in this article, the mobile space may not be a place to avoid
      forms much longer. Instead, it may become<em>the</em>place
      to encourage them.</p>

        rel="bookmark">Mobile Auto-Suggest On Steroids: Tap-Ahead Design
        Pattern</a></h2>
  <p>In contrast to desktop Web search, auto-suggest on mobile devices
      is subject to two additional limitations: typing avoidance and slower
      bandwidth. The new patent-pending design pattern,<strong>Tap-Ahead</strong>,
      uses continuous refinement to create an intuitive, authentically
      mobile auto-suggest solution. This helps dramatically reduce the
      amount of typing needed to enter queries, and utilizes slower mobile
      bandwidth in the most efficient manner. Using this novel design
      pattern, your customers can quickly access thousands of popular search
      term combinations by typing just a few initial characters.</p>
  <p>As John Ferrara wrote in his November 2010 UXMagazine
      article,<a href="http://www.uxmag.com/technology/psychic-search">“Psychic
        Search: a quick primer on search suggestions”</a>, today
      auto-suggest is practically ubiquitous in desktop Web search. In
      contrast to desktop Web, auto-suggest on mobile is (at least for now)
      fairly rare. The only mobile Website that currently implements
      auto-suggest is Google.com, and a handful of mobile auto-suggest
      implementations that currently exist come from native mobile apps
      built by leading online retailers like Amazon and Booking.com.</p>

        Mobile User Experiences</a></h2>
  <p>A positive first impression is essential to relationships. People
      look for trust and integrity, and they expect subsequent encounters to
      reflect and reinforce their first impression. The same principles
      apply to brands and their products. Design plays an important role in
      building lasting relationships with end users and, thus, in supporting
      the brand’s promise.</p>
  <p>Users expect mobile services to be relevant and user-friendly and
      to perform well. The limitations of the medium, however, impose
      significant challenges to designing products that meet all of those
      expectations. While often underestimated,<strong>performance is
        a crucial contributor</strong>to a trustworthy mobile user
      experience. Therefore, it should be considered a key driver in the
      design process.</p>
  <p>In this article,<strong>we’ll discuss performance in
        relation to design and present seven guidelines</strong>that
      can help shape design decisions related to performance while
      accounting for the needs of end users and businesses. These guidelines
      are based on the experiences of our teams in designing native mobile
      apps for a broad product portfolio and on multiple mobile platforms.</p>

  <p>The industry has evolved in many ways, but one particular area
      has affected how we build websites to a greater extent than any other.
      The surge in Web-enabled mobile devices has forged a subculture of
      visitors who require the adaptation of our websites to meet their
      needs. While mobile design is still in its infancy (and little primary
      research on mobile trends exist), we need to observe how this
      now-critical element of our industry is evolving, and the patterns
      which exist from current development efforts.</p>
  <p>The aim of this article is to showcase the variety of<strong>methods
        in which some of today’s most popular websites provide an
        interactive and (hopefully) useful mobile experience</strong>for
      their end users. There are plenty of big names which were analyzed,
      such as Facebook and Amazon, and you’ll see plenty of useful graphs to
      draw some inspiration from. With statistics and some really
      interesting revelations on the diversity of modern design, you can be
      excited about the future of mobile Web design.</p>

  <p>App Store is a competitive environment. Against more than 140,000
      apps, all screaming for attention, how do you make sure your app gets
      its time in the spotlight? What does it take to get good media

      how do you get them to buy it and show it to their friends?</p>
  <p>Following the simple rules laid out below, you will increase your
      chances in the battle for fame and glory. These tips might seem
      rudimentary or in-your-face obvious, but they are so often neglected

        rel="bookmark">Web Development For The iPhone And iPad: Getting
        Started</a></h2>
  <p>According to AdMob, the<strong>iPhone operating system
        makes up 50% of the worldwide smartphone market</strong>, with the
      next-highest OS being Android at 24%. Sales projections for the Apple
      iPad run anywhere from one to four million units in the first year.
      Like it or not, the iPhone OS, and Safari in particular, have become a
      force to be reckoned with for Web developers. If you haven’t already,
      it’s time to dive in and familiarize yourself with the tools required
      to optimize websites and Web applications for this OS.</p>
  <p>Thankfully, Safari on iPhone OS is a really great browser. Just
      like Safari 4 for the desktop, it has great CSS3 and HTML5 support. It
      also has some slick interface elements right out of the box, which
      sometimes vary between the iPhone and iPad. Lastly, because the iPhone
      OS has been around for quite some time now, a lot of resources are
      available.</p>
