<p><strong>Extra Credit</strong></p>

<p><strong>Policy on Reuse of&nbsp;Content</strong></p>
<p>All materials submitted must be original materials developed solely for use in this course and must conform to UMUC's academic policies. Submission of reused materials may result in a reduced grade or non-acceptance of the assignment, at the instructor&rsquo;s discretion.</p>
<p><strong>Policy on Late or Missed Assignments and Projects</strong></p>
<p>Unless a major accident, illness, or work assignment (with supporting documentation) prevents you from submitting work on time, late assignments will not be accepted. If a late exemption is granted, a late penalty may be applied of 20% per day late. The decision to accept a late assignment is at the sole discretion of the instructor in all situations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  
<h1>PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS</h1>
  
 <h3>Assignments:&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Assignments will be given throughout the term covering the material discussed in class the week before. Assignments must be submitted on the due dates or there will be a 30% point reduction for each class period late. No assignment will be accepted after the final exam time.</p>
<p>Grading will be 80% objective (results, explanations, conclusions) and 20% subjective (neatness, clarity, extra work). A project report that minimally meets all specifications will receive a score of 80% of the total points. If any portion of a project is plagiarized (Using some one&rsquo;s code and saying it is your own), the entire project will receive a score of zero.</p>
<p>Assignment&nbsp;1: HTML &nbsp;(15%)</p>
<p>Assignment 2: Colors&nbsp;and&nbsp;Images&nbsp;(15%)</p>
<p>Assignment 3: CSS2(15%)</p>
<h3>Website Project<em>:</em></h3>
<p>The purpose of the project is to demonstrate your ability to apply the skills that&nbsp;you have learned during the course by creating a fully functional web site using&nbsp;various tools and methodologies, including HTML5, Web graphics, and Cascading Style Sheets.</p>
<h4>Website Proposal (5%)</h4>
<p>You will create a website proposal, the main purpose of which is that you learn to conduct&nbsp;good project planning. Present this as a 5-10 minute presentation to the class using a PowerPoint slide show. Review and critique your fellow classmates' draft website proposals.</p>
<p>Your project can be a website designed for your workplace, nonprofit/volunteer work, or another business/organization, real or fictitious. &nbsp;Hopefully, the project will be something of benefit that you can take away from this course.</p>
<h4>Create your full Website (30%)</h4>
<p>Your completed website must contain a minimum of five html web pages (not including a references page, if you use other authors' work with their permission), properly hand-coded by you to include standards compliant HTML5 and CSS3. Your website must be original work created during this term and cannot have been previously created for any other purpose. &nbsp;Finally, you will review and critique fellow classmates' completed website projects.</p>
<h3>Final Exam (20%)</h3>
<p>The final exam will be comprehensive and cover topics discussed throughout the course.</p>
<h3>Attendance:</h3>
<p>Class attendance is mandatory and understanding each lesson depends on understanding the previous lesson.&nbsp; The student is responsible for any work missed due to absence.</p>
