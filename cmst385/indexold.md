<h1 id="Week0" class="week">Welcome to CMST 385</h1>

![Me](../Go.png)This is a classic Face-to-Face class and we meet entirely in person. There will be no online discussions and if you have a question you can ask in class or email me at  

<p style="margin-top: 0;"><script>AntiSpam("moc", "tsmc+82.1lmr", "liamg", "CMST385", "")</script></p>

I will post handouts and hyperlinks to videos for the class on this web page which is accessible through the URL [http://rlaurie.pancakeapps.com/c385/](http://rlaurie.pancakeapps.com/c385/ "Right click this link and open in new tab")

Please bookmark (favorites) this URL in your browser so that you can easily return to it as the course progresses.

### So lets get started...
 
The course has as a prerequisite of either IFSM201 or CMIS102 to insure students come into the class with intermediate computer skills.  This course has a final exam so it is important that you learn HTML and CSS coding so you do well on the assignments and exam.

The primary references for the class will be the following web sites:

+ [www.w3schools.com/html/](http://www.w3schools.com/html/ "Right click this link and open in new tab") a great reference for both HTML and CSS
+ [http://www.littlewebhut.com/html/](http://www.littlewebhut.com/html/ "Right click this link and open in new tab") a good reference with tutorial videos
+ [learn.shayhowe.com/](http://learn.shayhowe.com/ "Right click this link and open in new tab") created by a professional web developer. 

UMUC no longer utilizes books for their courses, because free online resources have been setup for the course as can be viewed at [LEO](http://campus.umuc.edu/ "Right click this link and open in new tab").

However, you may enjoy the course more if you purchase the book _Learn to Code HTML & CSS_ that is available through [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321940520 "Right click this link and open in new tab") as either [paperback](http://www.amazon.com/Learn-Code-HTML-CSS-Websites/dp/0321940520/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8 "Right click this link and open in new tab") or [ebook](http://www.amazon.com/Learn-Code-HTML-CSS-Websites-ebook/dp/B00JVQX7V8/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8 "Right click this link and open in new tab"). We will be using the author's [web site](http://learn.shayhowe.com/ "Right click this link and open in new tab") as one of the resources for the course. Most of the information in the book is on his web site  [learn.shayhowe.com/](http://learn.shayhowe.com/ "Right click this link and open in new tab"), but a book is often more convenient, especially if you have only one computer screen to work on assignments.

Print all Week 1 materials described below that are posted as PDF files. I recommend using the freeware version of [PDFXChangeViewer](http://www.docu-track.com/home/prod_user/PDF-XChange_Tools/pdfx_viewer "Right click this link and open in new tab"), which allows you to make notes and save them to any PDF file or you can use Adobe Acrobat Reader.

All software used in this class is freeware and I strive to find software that can be run on all common operating systems (Windows, MacOSX, Linux). 

I recommend that you get started with Week 1 content today, by clicking Week 1 in the navigation bar above or scrolling down.

<h2 id="Week1" class="week">Week 1: Internet, World Wide Web, and HTML</h2>
  
![Network Stack](NetworkStack.gif) The first week is primarily lecture with some hands on setup and HTML coding is required for Assignment 1. The first class will cover a general explanation of the terminology, components that make up the Internet, and World Wide Web. You will be learning HTML5 and CSS3 coding in this class and you are expected to use these standards for all assignments in the class.

**Read LEO > Week 1 > Introduction to the Internet** 

[www.w3schools.com](http://www.w3schools.com/ "Right click this link and open in new tab") is an excellent tutorial and reference web site that will be used as the primary source of information. They offer certificates for $95 if you are looking for a certificate in this area.
 
Please read and work through the first 7 chapters of [www.w3schools.com - HTML(5) Tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp "Right click this link and open in new tab") prior to the first class.

 1. [HTML Introduction](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp "Right click this link and open in new tab")

Bring your notebook computer to class, because there will be some class time for demonstration, hands-on coding, and asking questions. You also need to bring a USB Thumb Drive to class for storing and transferring computer files. 

I will utilize PowerPoint slides to introduce HTML and CSS concepts throughout the class. Please print the slide set and all posted PDF documents as they will be your primary source of information in the class. PowerPoint handouts are posted with four slides per page, and it is best to print in color so that you can see the syntax format of the code:

 + [DropBox](https://db.tt/iqJp1nOx) will be used used to store files and also as a web host. If you are not already a member of Dropbox, then please click [here](https://db.tt/iqJp1nOx "Right click this link and open in new tab").
    1. Download and install Dropbox to your home computers. 
    1. Create a login and password for Dropbox and don't forget it. 
	1. You will need to select one folder for Dropbox so make it easy to find. 
	1. Create a sub-folder called **CMST385_YourName**, where YourName is your name. Store all resource files for the course in this folder.  
 + [Pancake.io](https://www.pancake.io/ "Right click this link and open in new tab") is a great way to host a free website using DropBox.  
    - Uses DropBox sub folder located at **Dropbox\Apps\Pancake.io**. 
	- All files placed in the folder will be hosted as a static website.
    - yourURL.pancakeapps.com will be the URL for tout web site after setting up Pancake.io and linking to your DropBox. 

I have created a short 3 minute video about how to setup a Dropbox Pancake.io Web Sever available at <http://www.screencast.com/t/lPFiTbJs>

<h2 id="Week3" class="week">Week 3: Colors and Web Graphics</h2>

![High Contrast](colors.png)This week we will cover the topics of specifying colors and utilizing web images. When selecting color combinations it is important to select colors that have high contrast so they are easily readable. Therefore, it is best to select dark text and light back-ground colors, which also optimizes a web page for printing.

**Read LEO > Week 3 > Working with Images**

Please print the slide set and all posted PDF documents as they will be your primary source of information in the class:

Some web sites to search for images:

 + <http://www.freebuttons.com>
 + <https://images.google.com/>
 + <https://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/>
 + <https://search.creativecommons.org/>

You will need to use an image editor to develop web graphics this week. One possibility for freeware is the *GIMP*, which is available for free and runs on Windows, MacOS, and Linux. GIMP has most of the features as Adobe PhotoShop including layer capability. Another easy to use graphics editor that works well on windows is PhotoFiltre V6 or V7 freeware.

Inkscape is a powerful Open Source vector graphics program that works on Windows, MacOS, and Linux. It has many features, which will take much time to master.

<h2 id="Week4" class="week">Week 4: CSS Formatting Documents</h2>

![High Contrast](../girl-painting-on-easel200h.png)This week we will introduce CSS, as a method for controlling the presentation of a web page or an entire web site. Assignment 3 will be modifying your existing web pages using CSS. No browser supports the entire CSS version 3 specification so it is best to learn and use CSS version 2 properties first, which are supported by all modern browsers. We will focus on CSS2 properties this week as an introduction to CSS and all CSS2 properties are upwardly comparable with CSS3.
