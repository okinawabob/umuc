<h1>GRADING INFORMATION</h1>

<p>There will be three hour tests each worth 100 points, which will be given at the beginning the first class of Week 3, 5, and 7. The Final Exam is worth a maximum of 200 points and will be given the last class of Week 8.</p>
<h3>Assessment Items:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hour Test 1 = 100 points (Beginning of first class Week 3)</li>
<li>Hour Test 2 = 100 points (Beginning of first class Week 5)</li>
<li>Hour Test 3 = 100 points (Beginning of first class Week 7)</li>
<li>Comprehensive Final Exam = 200 points</li>
</ul>
<h3>Course Grade</h3>
<p>Your course grade will calculated in two different ways and the higher percentile will be used to determine your course grade based on 400 points. If the final exam is higher than your lowest hour test grade, it will replace your lowest hour test grade and the final exam will be worth 200 points or 50% of your grade. If the final exam is your lowest grade, then I will use all three hour test scores and the final exam will be counted as 100 points or 25% of your grade.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The course grade will be determined using the following percentages for total points for the course:</p>
<ul>
<li>A = 100 to 90%</li>
<li>B = 89.9% to 80%</li>
<li>C = 79.9% to 70%</li>
<li>D = 69.9% to 60%</li>
<li>F &lt; 60%</li>
</ul>

  
<h1>PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS</h1>
  
<h3>Homework:</h3>
<p>Students are required to keep a homework notebook that will be collected during the final exam and reviewed. The homework must be done on separate and identifiable pages from the class notes and be in sequence. Students are expected to attempt all assigned problems, show all work as step-by-step procedures, and check their resulting answers with the solution. Ask questions about problems that could not be successfully completed during the help sessions or post your solution on the board prior to the start of class for review at the beginning of class.</p>
<p>Attempt to do the assigned homework problems. The key to success in mathematics is working problems. The more problems you work, the better you will become at working them. Practice doing the sequential steps in solving the example and assigned problems to learn the step-by-step procedures, algorithms and mathematical concepts. Please use as much paper as necessary to work out the problems step-by-step. Writing down the answer alone is usually not acceptable for most problems and will disable your learning processing.</p>
<h3>Hour Tests:</h3>
<p>A total of three hour tests will be administered in class that will cover material presented in class since the previous test. The tests are closed book and will be similar to the homework so it is important that you do all assigned homework problems. You will need to use pencils, eraser, and your scientific calculator on tests and the final exam. Smart phones may not be used. You are permitted to bring in one 8.5" x 11" sheet of single sided handwritten notes to each hour test.</p>
<p>It is unfair for any student to take a test after the scheduled time. Pending Professor's approval, the student may request via email, before or during the test time, to take a makeup test due to a verifiable excusable absence. Events that constitute an excusable absence are: illness, emergency, and military duty. The makeup test maybe more difficult than the one given to the class and is scheduled at the convenience of UMUC staff. The test must be taken before the next scheduled class, and it is the student's responsibility to go to the UMUC office at their prearranged scheduled time to take the test. Failure to do so will result in a score of zero on the test.</p>
<h3>Final Exam:</h3>
<p>A different professor writes the common <strong>comprehensive final exam</strong> that is required for this course. This final exam will include the topics and skills covered in the required readings, lectures, and class discussions. The final exam is closed-book and notes. A formula sheet will be provided for final exam. You will need to use your scientific calculator, pencils, and an eraser on the final exam. Smart phones may not be used.</p>
<h3><em>Strategies for Success in MATH103:</em></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Please read all sections before they are covered in class</strong>&nbsp; and try working through the example problems after reading through the material in each assigned section.</li>
<li><strong>Purchase the recommended scientific calculator &nbsp;</strong>soon after enrolling in class, because they sometimes sell out. The recommended calculator is the Texas Instrument TI-36X Pro or similar 2-line scientific calculator. This calculator features an easy to use two-line algebraic display and includes all the functions used in the course and is usually &lt; $20.</li>
<li><strong>Attend all&nbsp;Lecture Sections &nbsp;</strong>to learn the material and watch carefully the step-by-step problem solving procedures. Your tuition buys you admission to the scheduled show and there are no second showings. Class attendance is mandatory and understanding each lesson depends on understanding the previous lesson. To understand what goes on in class you must be there. Missing class and then expecting to find out what went on from someone else does not work in Math. Mathematics is NOT a spectator sport. It takes effort, desire, determination, discipline, and time management.</li>
<li><strong>Attend optional recitation Help Sessions</strong>&nbsp; that are offered in addition to the scheduled class meetings. During these sessions, your instructor will be available to provide you with individual support and tutoring. This service is available to you free of charge.</li>
<li><strong>Allocate 20 hours per week to MATH103 class</strong>. &nbsp;Students should expect their study time (including reading, homework, and exercises) to be 2-3 times the amount of lecture time. That is, for every hour spent in class, you should expect to spend 2-3 hours out of class studying, reading, and completing homework exercises for this mathematics class. I would recommend enrolling only MATH103 this term unless you are a full-time student and not Mathematics challenged.</li>
<li><strong>Stay on Schedule &nbsp;</strong>to keep pace with the course, assigned readings, lectures, and homework. Students who fall behind or fail to attempt the homework exercises could find themselves falling behind schedule and in difficulty. Try to incorporate the skills and methods learned in this course in everyday life. It is the best way to learn.</li>
<li><strong>Participate in Class Discussions &nbsp;</strong>is encouraged and it is important to ask questions during class. Doing this will enhance your learning and success in this class. For example, if you find any problems difficult or unsolvable, ask questions concerning those problems in recitation help sessions.</li>
<li><strong>Do Homework assignments incrementally after covered in class. &nbsp;</strong>Students do best when study sessions are between 30 to 60 minutes instead of long cram sessions. It is better to do 3 one-hour study sessions than 1 three-hour study session. Allow enough time to complete the required assignments without getting stressed. Come back to unsolved problems after a break or good night sleep.</li>
</ol>


<h1>CLASS & ASSIGNMENT SCHEDULE</h1>

<p>This is a tentative schedule. The class may go ahead or behind the schedule printed below. It is the student's responsibility to prepare the work that is actually covered each week prior to the next week. Please read and review the sections prior to the class.</p>
