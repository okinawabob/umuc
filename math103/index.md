<h1 id="Week0" class="week">Welcome to MATH103</h1>

![Me](../MyMug150_2014.jpg)This is a classic Face-to-Face class and we meet entirely in person. There will be no online discussions and if you have a question you can ask in class or email me at  

<p style="margin-top: 0;"><script>AntiSpam("moc", "htam+82.1lmr", "liamg", "MATH103", "")</script></p>

However, I will post all handouts and hyperlinks to videos for the class on this web page which is accessible at the URL 
[rlaurie.pancakeapps.com/math103/](http://rlaurie.pancakeapps.com/math103/).

### So lets get started...

This is a fast paced mathematics course in an 8 week session.

I recommend you allocate approximately 20 hours per week to this course:

 * Lecture = 6 hours per week
 * Optional help session for one hour after each class = 2 hours per week
 * Reading study, video watching, and homework = 12 hours per week or more if you are mathematically challenged

If you have a day job, I recommend that you enroll only in this course this session, because there will be a lot of homework. You should have placed at the MATH012 level before enrolling in this course, or successfully completed MATH009. Unfortunately, UMUC is not enforcing the prerequisite for this course which is MATH012 and unprepared students may feel uncomfortable in this course.  Typically 20% of the students do not pass the first attempt, unless I give you this warning notification so you can properly allocate time for the course. The course has a common final exam for all UMUC sections worldwide. Therefore, I must remain on schedule to cover all topics.  
  
Before the first class, I recommend that you download and print the [MATH103 Course Summary](Math103Summary.pdf  "Right click this link and open in new tab") or latest updated version of the syllabus that can be found in the LEO classroom or at the [UMUC Asia schedule web page](http://webapps.umuc.edu/soc/asia.cfm  "Right click this link and open in new tab"). Also print all Week 1 materials which are posted as PDF files below.


![ebook](ebook.jpg) UMUC has moved to free online resources to support all courses and Will Tenney a UMUC faculty member has written a 433 page eBook titled [***Math for Today's World***](math103ebook.pdf). The eBook is a work in progress and the latest version is available for free download in the [LEO Course Resources](https://campus.umuc.edu/  "Right click this link and open in new tab"). The eBook contains examples and exercises for each section that we will use for the course. Answers to all odd numbered exercises are in the appendix at the end of the book. You are required to do the exercises at the end of each section, that I ask you to do and all will be odd numbered problems so you can check your answer. 

![Blitzer Textbook](Textbook.jpg) In the past, students did well with the professionally written textbook *Thinking Mathematically* by Robert Blitzer *5th Edition*, ISBN: 0321645855 [available used from amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Mathematically-Fifth-Robert-Blitzer/dp/0321645855/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1437573835&sr=8-1&keywords=0321645855 "Right click this link and open in new tab"). If you want to buy a textbook to support the course I would recommend it as it goes into more depth on each topic then the eBook. Used textbooks can be acquired from someone that took the course before or at   [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Mathematically-Fifth-Robert-Blitzer/dp/0321645855/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1437573835&sr=8-1&keywords=0321645855 "Right click this link and open in new tab"). Sample chapters are available for Chapters 5 and 6 in the [LEO Course Resources](https://campus.umuc.edu/ "Right click this link and open in new tab") and examining these chapters will help you through the first two weeks of the course and prepare you for Test 1. 

Please acquire the following items before the first class: 

 * Spiral notebook or ring binder for doing all homework
 * Several pencils or better a 0.7mm mechanical pencil with soft HB graphite
 * Good Eraser
 * ![TI-36XPro](pic_TI-30XPro.png) Buy a recommended multi-line display Scientific calculator:  
   - **Texas Instrument TI-36X Pro** [Reference Manual](TI36PRO_Guidebook_EN.pdf "Right click this link and open in new tab") @ AAFES Price = $18.99
   - or Texas Instrument TI-30X IIS (solar) [Reference Manual](TI-30XIIS-B_ReferenceManual.pdf "Right click this link and open in new tab") 
   - or Casio fx-300ES Plus [Reference Manual](fx-300ES_PLUS_EN.pdf "Right click this link and open in new tab")  
   - or Casio fx-115 ES Plus [Reference Manual](fx-115_991ES_PLUS_C_EN.pdf "Right click this link and open in new tab")

I recommend that you get started with Week 1 content today, by clicking Week 1 in the navigation bar above or scrolling down.

Test 1 is scheduled for next week first class and will cover content from or eBook Chapters 1, 2, and 3  (Blitzer sections 5.1-5.6 and 6.1-6.4). Test 1 is closed book, but you are permitted to bring in one half page of single sided handwritten notes that is 8.5 inches x 5.5 inches. I suggest you simply take a standard letter size paper and fold it in half. You can add to these notes in Test 2 and 3.  You need to bring pencil, eraser, and calculator to Test 1. You may download and view [Sample Test 1](2012S1_test1.tst.pdf "Right click this link and open in new tab") available as a PDF file with answers attached.



<h2 id="Week3" class="week">Week 3: Quadratic Equations, Graphing, and Functions</h2>

This week we will begin with Test 1, which will cover content from eBook Chapters 1, 2, and 3 (Blitzer sections 5.1-5.6 and 6.1-6.4). Test 1 is closed book, but you are permitted to bring in one half page of handwritten notes on one side of an 8.5 inches x 5.5 inches area. I suggest you simply take a standard letter size paper and fold it in half. You can add to these notes for test 2 and 3.  You may download and view [Sample Test 1](2012S1_test1.tst.pdf "Right click this link and open in new tab") available as a PDF file with answers attached.

After Test 1, we will continue with eBook Chapter 4 covering the important topic of Quadratic Equations to include polynomial operations, factoring, and the Quadratic Formula. Blitzer Section 6.5 has similar content coverage.

A quadratic equation is a polynomial equation of the second degree, having the general form:

<figure><img alt="Quadratic Equation" src="QuadraticEqStd.gif"></figure>
The letters *a*, *b* and *c* are called coefficients: *a* is the coefficient of *x<sup>2</sup>*, *b* is the coefficient of *x*, and *c* is the constant coefficient. A quadratic equation has two solutions (i.e., solutions for the unknown term *x*). In some cases, these solutions can have the same value. The values of the solutions can be computed using the quadratic formula as shown below:
  
<figure><img alt="Quadratic Equation" src="QuadraticFormStd.gif"></figure>
For example, the solutions of the quadratic equation

<figure><img alt="Quadratic Equation" src="QuadraticEqNum.gif"></figure>  
can be determined by first substituting 2 for *a*, -14 for *b*, and 20 for *c* in the quadratic forumula 

<figure><img alt="Quadratic Equation" src="QuadraticFormNum.gif"></figure>  
and then solving the expression, which gives the solutions of the equation as *x* = 5 and *x* = 2.  

As the week progresses we will cover eBook Chapter 5.1 covering Cartesian coordinate graphing and functions. You will plot points, lines, and functions on graph paper.

 1. The ac-Method is a very systematic factoring method that allows you to factor trinomial mathematical expressions. Once you understand how to use the ac-method you can usually find the factors much quicker than FOIL. I found several videos on youtube.com covering the ac-Method. Try working out the exercises illustrated in these videos to understand the step-by-step factoring process. Then try it on homework exercises. If you find a different video that is helpful and easy to understand please email me and provide a hyperlink.

Please bring your notebook contining homework, which I will examine for borderline grade cases. 
Please bring your Tests 1, 2, and 3 to me during the final exam time. I re-examine these tests when determining final grades if you are within a few points of the next grade in the course.

I hope you feel are more comfortable with mathematics after taking this course and you will find it a useful skill when you apply it in life situations. It is your best critical thinking skill to help you make financial decisions. Mathematics is the basis of technology development and understanding physical sciences.
