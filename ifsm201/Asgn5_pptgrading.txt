Good presentation. Slides nice. Font size was too small for reading and might consider making bold. No handouts 4 slides per page. Good graphics in presentation and references.

Citation is suppose to be using APA format. 

Suppose to submit handouts 4 slides per page.

You should use one of the the themes provided in PowerPoint. I couldn't get the details from slide show upload.

Nance, didn't attend last class so no presentation done 
Only two references 
No handouts submitted could have been a PDF file.

Sean, you didn't attend last class so no presentation done.
Your presentation file had text too small for a presentation to be readable. Should make bold too for readability.
References were not well organized and would be best done in bullet list.
slide 2 is unreadable in powerpoint likely due to copy and past from web browser with encoding error.
Good animation and transitions.
No handouts submitted could have been a PDF file. 

Only six slides but suppose to be 8.
