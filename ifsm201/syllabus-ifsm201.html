  <h2>GRADING INFORMATION</h2>
  <p>This is a hybrid class and attendance to all classes is required. Your course grade will be determined based on graded items in the class and class attendance. If you do not attend 3 or more classes this will result in a grade of FN = Failure due to Non-attendance. If you cannot attend all classes please consider enrolling in the online version of the course. </p>
  <h3>Assessment Items:</h3>
  <p>Assessment items include four Quizzes based on module content, four Assignments covering standard applications to include word processing, spreadsheets, databases, and presentation graphics, seven Discussions, and 90% passing score on Academic Integrity tutorial. To receive all the points on the discussions you must reply to two other class participants.</p>

  </ul>
  <h3>Course Grade Determination</h3>
  <p>The course grade will be determined using the following percentages of total points for the course:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>A = 100 to 90%</li>
  <li>B = 89.9% to 80%</li>
  <li>C = 79.9% to 70%</li>
  <li>D = 69.9% to 60%</li>
  <li>F &lt; 60%</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Weekly Classroom Discussion Topics and Participation</h3>
  <p>Discussions (conducted in LEO) will facilitate the similar student-student interaction via the LEO classroom that is found in traditional classroom courses. Since we will meet once per week the online discussions will be approximately half of what you will find in an online class. You will need to respond to at least two other people for each discussion </p>
  <h4>Policy for Classroom Discussions, E-Mail, and Messaging</h4>
  <p>All students will be held to the highest standards for language and content in classroom discussions, e-mails and discussion interaction (including attachments).</p>
  <p>Abusive, derogatory and inappropriate language and content, or personal attacks of any kind, will not be tolerated. Any student engaging in this type of behavior will be reported to the UMUC provost. Read the UMUC policy on the Code of Student Conduct, a link to which is located in the <strong>Academic Policies</strong> section below.</p>
  <p>All interaction must be relevant to the topic being discussed and show a reasoned approach to the discussion. In online discussions, include information from the text and other sources to make your point, if possible. Remember to cite your sources properly so it does not appear that they are plagiarized.</p>
  <h3>Extra Credit</h3>
  <p>Extra Credit is not available in this course. So please do your best on all assignments.</p>
  <h3>Plagiarism Policy</h3>
  <p>Plagiarism is an act or instance of using or closely imitating the language and thoughts of another author without authorization and the representation of that author's work as one's own, as by not crediting the original author. If you copy another students or copy an authors work without referencing it have commited plagarism. Such an act may result in automatic course failure and suspension.</p>
  <h4>Turnitin.com</h4>
  <p>UMUC has a license agreement with Turnitin, an educational tool that helps identify and prevent plagiarism from Internet resources. Your instructor may use the service in class, either by requiring you to submit assignments electronically to Turnitin, by submitting assignments on your behalf, or by providing the option for you to check your own work for originality. The Turnitin Originality Report will indicate the amount of original text in your work and whether all the material that you quoted, paraphrased, summarized, or used from another source is appropriately referenced.</p>
  <p>If you or your instructor submits all or part of your assignment to the Turnitin service, Turnitin will by default store that assignment in its database. The assignment will be checked for any matches between your work and other material stored in Turnitin's database. If you object to the long-term storage of your work in the Turnitin database, you must let your instructor know no later than two weeks after the start of this class.</p>
  <p>You have three options regarding the storage of your assignment in the Turnitin database: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>You can do nothing; your assignment will then be stored in the Turnitin database for the duration of UMUC's contract with Turnitin</li>
    <li>You can ask your instructor to have Turnitin store your assignment only for the duration of the semester or term, then have your assignment deleted from the Turnitin database once the class is over</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Please note: Your instructor may use other services in addition to or in place of Turnitin to check your work for plagiarism.</p>
  <h3>Policy on Reuse of Papers</h3>
  <p>All materials submitted must be original materials developed solely for use in this course and must conform to UMUC's academic policies. Submission of reused materials may result in a reduced grade or non-acceptance of the assignment, at the instructor&rsquo;s discretion.</p>
  <h3>Policy on Late or Missed Assignments and Projects</h3>
  <p>The assignments, participation (discussion topics and web activities), concept checkups and quizzes need to be submitted on time per the <strong>Due Date</strong>. The assigned activity is generally due ten days after the date described in class. Therefore, unless a major accident, illness, or work assignment (with supporting documentation) prevents you from submitting work on time, late assignments will not be accepted. If a late exemption is granted, a late penalty of 20% per day late may be applied. The decision to accept a late assignment is at the sole discretion of the instructor in all situations.</p>



  <h2>PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS</h2>
  <p>See grading information for details on the points/percentage breakdown for the class.</p>
  <h3>Academic Integrity Tutorial</h3>
  <p>All students are required to complete the Academic Integrity Tutorial (found at <a href="https://www.umuc.edu/students/academic-integrity/tutorial.cfm">https://www.umuc.edu/students/academic-integrity/tutorial.cfm</a>). This tutorial must be completed no later than the end of Week 6. No points are granted if the tutorial is not completed by the due date with a 90% or higher on the quiz. The quiz maybe taken multiple times.</p>
  <h3>Discussions and Classroom Participation</h3>
  <p>While participation is critical throughout the course, there will be graded Discussions (conducted in LEO).</p>
  <h3>Quizzes</h3>
  <p>IFSM 201 will utilize module quizzes that cover content covered during the term. The content of the quizzes covers the module content so it is important to work through all modules before attempting the quizzes.</p>
  <h3>Assignments</h3>
  <p>Assignments address the following course outcomes:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Use information technology effectively for personal and professional productivity</li>
  <li>Use office applications effectively and efficiently for real-world use to organize, analyze, and communicate information</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Assignment 1: Word Processing - Computer Shopping</h4>
  <p>For this assignment you will create a word processing document that describes the selection of a personal computer from a list of three that you find interesting.  You will need to construct a table for this assignment that describes the computer components. You may shop online or at a retail store for this assignment.</p>
  <h4>Assignment 2: Spreadsheets (Personal Budget)</h4>
  <p>Students create a personal budget to demonstrate your ability to correctly create and format an Excel spreadsheet and incorporate appropriate formulas to provide a useful budgeting tool for personal financing. After completing your budget, students answer 3 &ldquo;critical thinking&rdquo; questions about your budget. Students may choose fictional data, but the items and amounts should be realistic. The spreadsheet file needs to be uploaded to LEO.</p>

  <h4>Assignment 3: Database (Project Management)</h4>
  <p>This assignment is designed to apply the student&rsquo;s understanding of the assigned readings and information from lecture regarding databases. Students will create four database tables and populate them with specified data items. The tables will be linked together using one to many relationships using primary key and foreign key fields. A form and report will be created for the database. A query will be created using data items from two linked tables. The database file needs to be uploaded to LEO.</p>
  <h4>Assignment 4: Presentation Graphics (Research Presentation)</h4>
  <p>The research presentation assignment will require each student to make a presentation using slides created in a presentation graphics application such as PowerPoint. Each student will make a 10 minute presentation to the class using 8 slides about some topic of interest related to computers. The student needs to cite three external reference from credible sources, and specify these usin APA formatted references for their research on their slides. The presentation also needs to be uploaded to LEO.</p>
