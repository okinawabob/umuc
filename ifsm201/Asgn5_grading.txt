Dana great presentation. Only suggestion is to go with higher contrast between background and text color. 

You were suppose to print handouts with 4 slides per page, but did 1 slide per page. Not sure if you know how to do that. 

Thank you for taking the class seriously.

Good contrast on slides. Some slides could have had more content. Your name is suppose to be on slides. No slide about computer selected or missing. Good presentation in class.

On slides go with higher contrast between background and text color. Sometimes difficult to read. You were suppose to print handouts with 4 slides per page, but did 1 slide per page. Not sure if you know how to do that. 

Sometimes text is too small to read on screen. Suggest making bigger especially on slides without much content. 

Good talk. 

Constance, 

Good slide design and content. Good contrast makes it readable. 
Good handouts.

Citation is suppose to be using APA format. 

Suppose to submit handouts 4 slides per page.

Sorry you couldn't be here for actual presentation. 

You should use one of the the themes provided in PowerPoint. I couldn't get the details from slide show upload.

No handouts submitted with 4 slides per page.
