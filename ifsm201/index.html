<p><img src="../MyMug150_2014.gif" alt="My Face">This is a Hybrid class which meets 2.5 hours per week for lecture and you are required to attend all lecture classes. In lieu of the second class you are expected to work on assignments independently and work through Open Learning Initiative (<abbr title="Open Learning Initiative">OLI</abbr>) content&nbsp;that is integrated into&nbsp;LEO. Use of a computer, Internet connection, and <a rel="noopener" href="http://campus.umuc.edu/" target="_blank">LEO</a> (<a rel="noopener" href="http://campus.umuc.edu/" target="_blank">campus.umuc.edu</a>) is required for hybrid classes.</p>

<p>You will be required to submit all assignments online using <a rel="noopener" href="http://campus.umuc.edu/" target="_blank">LEO</a>, and consider this hybrid class as good training for taking an Online UMUC class in the future. <a rel="noopener" href="http://campus.umuc.edu/" target="_blank">LEO</a> can be accessed using either <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Use this link to access all your classes" href="http://campus.umuc.edu/">http://campus.umuc.edu</a> (preferred) or <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Alternative path to LEO with classes accessed using pull down menu" href="http://learn.umuc.edu/">http://learn.umuc.edu/ </a> (backup)</p>
<p>The Microsoft Office 2010 Suite is recommended for all assignments because it is available in the UMUC computer lab/testing center. However, Microsoft recently came out with Office 2016 so if you want to spend money on software then you are likely better off with the newest version. One issue with Microsoft Office is they significantly change the adaptive Ribbon User Interface with each version so it is sometimes difficult to find the command you want. Another issue is that Microsoft has never ported the Microsoft Access database application to MacOS.</p>
<p>Alternatively, I recommend using the free <a rel="noopener" href="http://www.libreoffice.org/" target="_blank">LibreOffice</a>, which is available at <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="http://www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice-fresh/">www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice-fresh/</a> and functions equally well on Windows 7-10, MacOSX, and Linux. Good documentation is available at <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="http://www.libreoffice.org/get-help/documentation/">www.libreoffice.org/get-help/documentation/</a> and I recommend you download and read the <em>LibreOffice Getting Started Guide </em>if you chose to use this freeware software. LibreOffice is a fork of OpenOffice open-source software and has better support.</p>
<p>It is recommended that you print posted PDF documents at the beginning of the week like PowerPoint slide handouts (4 slides per page) and assignments prior to class so that you can take notes when they are covered in lecture.</p>
<p>Please bring a USB Drive that is 1 GigaByte or greater to class this week and every week. It is best if the USB Drive attaches to your key ring so that it is less likely to be lost. You may use the UMUC computer lab to work on your assignments and all computers in the lab have Windows 7 and Microsoft Office 2010. Keep all files on your USB Drive if you intend to use the UMUC computer lab or your home computer to do your assignments. If you plan on using a MacOS computer then please format your USB Drive to exFAT or FAT32 so that it is readable by both MacOS and Windows. You may want to install LibreOffice to your USB Drive, which will allow it to run on any Windows computer including the ones in UMUC Computer Lab if you install <a rel="noopener" href="http://portableapps.com/" target="_blank">PortableApps.com</a> to your drive and also <a rel="noopener" href="http://portableapps.com/apps/office/libreoffice_portable" target="_blank">LibreOffice portable edition</a>. Unfortunately, LibreOffice is not installed on computers in the UMUC computer lab.</p>
<p>To make sure your home computer is properly set up for the class please review the Technical Requirements below:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">To ensure a smooth experience as you go through the course resources, please read the technical requirements provided below.

<h2 id="Week1" class="week">Week 1: Data Representation</h2>
<img title="Let us get started..." alt="Go" src="http://polaris.umuc.edu/%7Erlaurie/ifsm201/Wk1.png" style="display: inline; float: right; margin-left: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px;" />
<h3>Lecture This Week</h3>
<p>This week in lecture we will be discussing the Syllabus, LEO course management system, OLI Classroom, and investigate Data representation for different number systems used in computing and ASCII&nbsp;codes. Prior to class, please print and read the syllabus and the <strong><a rel="noopener" href="http://polaris.umuc.edu/%7Erlaurie/ifsm201/NumSysCode_IFSM201.pdf" target="_blank">Number Systems and Codes handout</a></strong>.</p>
<p>The LEO -Discussions are a kind of collective online discussion. This week you need to utilize five online discussions to introduce yourself and demonstrate that you have learned how to convert between various number systems and codes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Post your Introduction in the Discussion &gt;&gt; Introductions Topic</li>
<li>Post in the Number System and Codes Conversion Discussion</li>
<ul>
<li>Binary to Decimal Conversion</li>
<li>Binary to Hexadecimal conversion</li>
<li>Hexadecimal to Binary Conversion</li>
<li>Convert your name from ASCII to Hexadecimal</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>These LEO - Discussions exercises will provide you with an understanding of digital data, which is fundamental to understanding <q>How computers work?</q></p>
<p>The <em>file extension</em> is important in Windows, because it determines which application will open the file. Unfortunately, Microsoft hides file extensions by default, but it is useful to view the file extensions of known file types within Windows Explorer file display pane. File extensions can be viewed by opening Windows Explorer and selecting the menu item <br /> <code>Tools &gt; Folder Options &gt; View Tab</code>. <br /> Find and uncheck the check box labeled <q>Hide extensions of known file types</q>. You will now be able to see the difference between <code>filename.docx</code> file and <code>filename.pdf</code> file.</p>
<p>You must be logged into LEO and then click the <span>Link to the OLI Classroom</span> below from within LEO to access the OLI content.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the class or assignments feel free to post in the<em> <br /> LEO Discussion &gt; Ask your Professor</em>
  <br /> or  email me at:</p>

<p><strong></strong><strong>OVERVIEW AND OBJECTIVES</strong></p>
<p>This week you will be&nbsp;looking at&nbsp;the basic concepts or components used in the construction of database, read about different database structures, and investigate specific security issues related to use of databases. &nbsp;In addition, the relationships between Customer Relationship Management (CRM), data warehouses, and data mining will be introduced.&nbsp;<br /><br />After completing the work this week, you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify the basic organization and components of a database.</li>
<li>Define what is meant by the term customer relationship management (CRM).</li>
<li>Explain how data warehouses and data mining tools are used to perform CRM.</li>
<li>Identify the potential impact of CRM on a company's business.</li>
<li>Explain some of the trends in SCRM and changes that must be implemented. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Identify the importance of database security.</li>
<li>Apply an understanding of confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility to issues of database security.</li>
<li>Analyze a scenario to determine the type of database threat that is described.</li>
<li>Identify basic questions that need to be addressed when evaluating database security.</li>
<li>Identify steps an individual can take to secure information stored in personal databases or PII shared with businesses.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Content</h3>
<p>This week we will be discussing Databases in preparation for Assignment 3. I will utilize PowerPoint slides for lecture and discussion. Please print the following PDF files to include both the slide sets and Assignment 3.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a rel="noopener" href="http://polaris.umuc.edu/%7Erlaurie/ifsm201/5-Databases.pdf" target="_blank">Slide Set 5: Databases</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a rel="noopener" href="http://polaris.umuc.edu/%7Erlaurie/ifsm201/A3-DB.pdf" target="_blank">Assignment 3: Databases</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Prior to class use the Link to the OLI Classroom to class work through:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><strong style="color: inherit;">Module 3a - Databases: Basics of Databases</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>This will help you better understand the class lecture on databases. I will set the quiz to two attempts so please try taking the Quiz before&nbsp;class lecture, and a second time soon after the class lecturer if you want to try for a higher score.</div>
<p>Windows users have MS Access only in the Office Professional versions. MacOSX users will not have MS Access on any versions of MS Office, because Microsoft never ported the Access database application to MacOS. Therefore, if you would like to utilize MS Access to do Assignment 3&nbsp;you will likely need to utilize the UMUC Computer Lab/Testing Center to utilize MS Access.</p>
<p>Alternatively, <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice-still/" target="_blank">LibreOffice</a>&nbsp;could be used for Assignment 3, and is available for free <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice-still/" target="_blank">download</a> and LibreOffice Base is their database program. LibreOffice will run on any operating system: Windows, MacOSX, and Linux. They have good documentation available for free in the LibreOffice document Getting Started 4.2 which is available as a free <a rel="noopener" href="https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/images/b/b0/GS42-GettingStartedLO.pdf" target="_blank">download as PDF</a>. However, LibreOffice does not have the easy to use Wizards that Access has and will take more time to work through.</p>
<p>Under the Content tab, look under <strong>Course&nbsp;Resources</strong>&nbsp;(main Content tab on the top navigation bar) for optional online resources to assist you with MS Office or Open Office. And there are separate tutorials and a Tips file below for those using Open Office to complete this assignment.</p>

<h4>APA Requirements for This Class</h4>
<p>Much of the information below comes from the APA Tutorial, available through the Effective Writing Center, under the Resources tab above.&nbsp; For this class, the main focus of APA formatting is on citations and references, and papers with incorrect citations and/or references will lose points on the grade.</p>
<p>APA format is more than simply using in-text citations and full references. Writers apply APA format to their work for the following reasons:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Providing in-text citations and full references tells readers what sources were used to write an article or book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using APA format ensures consistency in the conventions writers use and readers expect in publications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Including in-text citations and full references credits writers in their field for the research they have conducted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using APA format protects writers from being plagiarized and from plagiarizing others.</p>
<p>The reference list gives the reader the information necessary to locate and retrieve any source you cite in your paper. &nbsp;Full references are always listed on a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">separate page</span> at the end of a paper and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">match one-to-one with a citation</span> that appears in a paper. &nbsp;Every source you cite in the paper must appear in your reference list; and, every entry in the reference list must be cited in your text.&nbsp; If you review other sources, but do not cite them, they are not included in the reference list.&nbsp; The reference page is labeled as: <strong>References&nbsp;</strong> centered and bolded and always plural.&nbsp; Each reference appears in alphabetical order by the first word, and no numbering is used.&nbsp; Each entry is single spaced, with the first line at the margin and the second and subsequent lines indented one-half inch.&nbsp; Use double spacing between entries.</p>
<p>For full examples of how to create correct APA citations and reference lists, go to:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.umuc.edu/library/guides/apa.shtml">http://www.umuc.edu/library/guides/apa.shtml</a></p>

<h2 id="Week7" class="week">Week 7: Issues in Computing - Security and the SDLC</h2>
<p><img alt="image" src="http://polaris.umuc.edu/%7Erlaurie/ifsm201/Wk7.png" style="display: inline; float: right; margin-left: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px;" /><strong>OVERVIEW AND OBJECTIVES</strong></p>
<p>You will complete your look at specific issues in computing this week by focusing on security in terms of confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA). &nbsp;Then the focus will shift to methods for protecting one's personally identifiable information (PII) from cyber criminal tactics.</p>
<p>As a separate but equally important avenue of exploration, the system development life cycle (SDLC) will be addressed. Because our focus this entire course has been on computer basics, it is important to understand how computer systems are designed and developed. &nbsp;There are several SDLC models that are in common use,&nbsp;and the various phases of development will be aligned with several of the models.</p>
